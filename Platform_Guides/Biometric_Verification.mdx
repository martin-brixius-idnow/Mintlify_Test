title: Biometric Authentication
description: Interactive face verification that initiates a biometric session, waits for the result, and returns an AuthenticationResult.
---

## Overview

This Step node executes a biometric face verification process. It orchestrates an interactive authentication flow with the end-user and processes the authentication result.

---

## Key Features

- ***Verification Initialization***: Creates an authentication request and sends a UI directive to the client to start the biometric verification process.
- ***Signal Waiting***: Waits for a signal containing the authentication result.
- ***Result Processing***: Once the signal is received, it computes the final authentication result by verifying the transaction or processing failure information.

This node is ideal for scenarios where strong biometric authentication is required as part of an identity workflow.

## Configuration

This node requires no configuration options. It uses the Third Party configuration parameters defined at the infrastructure level.

## Input Data

Input requirements for this node.

| DataBlock       | Mandatory | Description |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| `UserReference` | Yes       | Contains the unique subject identifier (subjectId) necessary to identify the user in the Keyless system. |

---

## Verdicts

Verdicts for this DataBlock.

| Scenario        | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `authenticated` | Biometric authentication succeeded. The user has been successfully authenticated. |
| `failed`        | Biometric authentication failed. This can be due to biometric mismatch, capture error, or technical issue. |

## Output Data

DataBlocks produced per verdict.

| Scenario        | DataBlocks produced     | Description |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **authenticated** | `AuthenticationResult` | Biometric authentication succeeded. The user has been successfully authenticated. |
| **failed**        | `AuthenticationResult` | Biometric authentication failed. This can be due to biometric mismatch, capture error, or technical issue. |
| **default**       | `âˆ…`                    | A technical or unexpected error occurred during processing. |
