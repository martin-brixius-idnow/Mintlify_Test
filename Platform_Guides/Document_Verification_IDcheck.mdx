description: AI-powered automated identity verification with document scanning and biometric capture
---

## Overview

Automated instant identity verification using AI and Machine Learning. Guides users through interactive document capture and biometric verification with real-time processing via IDCheck.io.

---

## Key Features

- **Interactive Capture** - SDK-guided document and biometric collection
- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Automated fraud detection and data extraction
- **Manual Review Option** - Human operator verification when needed
- **Multi-Document Support** - ID, passport, permits, visas, licenses, health cards
- **Biometric Verification** - Selfie and video liveness detection
- **Flexible Consent** - SDK or customer-managed consent handling

---

## Configuration

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `documentTypes` | Array | **Yes** | - | Document types to accept: `ID`, `PASSPORT`, `RESIDENT_PERMIT`, `VISA`, `DRIVING_LICENSE`, `HEALTH_CARD` |
| `biometricSampleTypes` | Array | No | `[]` | Biometric capture: `SELFIE`, `VIDEO`. Empty array = disabled |
| `biometricConsentHandling` | String | No | `SDK` | Consent collection: `SDK` (handled during capture) or `CUSTOMER` (pre-collected) |

---

## Input

- This node does not require any input DataBlocks â€” it initiates data collection automatically.

## Verdicts

The Document Verification process can produce four possible outcomes based on processing results.

| Verdict | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **verified** | The document and biometric samples (if configured) were successfully processed and data was extracted. Identity verification completed successfully. |
| **fraud_detected** | Fraud was detected on the document or biometric samples (if configured), or they were no longer valid. No identity data is extracted for security reasons. |
| **capture_failed** | The quality of the provided images did not allow for processing. Common causes include blur, glare, poor lighting, or incomplete document visibility. |
| **default** | A technical or unexpected error occurred during processing. This includes service unavailability, timeouts, or processing failures. |

## Output

DataBlocks produced per verdict.

| Verdict | DataBlocks Produced | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| **verified** | `DocumentVerification`, `BasicIdentity`, `ExtendedIdentity`, `DocumentData`, `DocumentImages`, `BiometricSamples`* | *`BiometricSamples` only if `biometricSampleTypes` configured |
| **fraud_detected** | `DocumentVerification` | No identity data extracted |
| **capture_failed** | `DocumentVerification` | Contains quality failure reasons |
| **default** | `DocumentVerification` | Contains error details |
