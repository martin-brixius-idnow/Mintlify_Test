title: IDcheck
description: Automated identity verification with document scanning and face matching.
---

IDcheck provides automated document-based identity verification with optional biometric face matching for fast, compliant onboarding and real-time fraud detection. Users capture ID documents and (optionally) biometric samples via SDK or API, while the backend verifies document authenticity, security features, and biometric consistency. Supports a wide range of government IDs and can include specialist review and advanced fraud detection.

---

## Key features

- **Interactive capture**: SDK-guided document and biometric collection on Web, iOS or Android.
- **AI-powered analysis**: Automatic recognition, OCR, MRZ/VIZ checks, barcode reading, security feature detection, and consistency checks.
- **Advanced fraud signal**: Detects repeated documents, synthetic identities, device/IP anomalies, and validates IBAN ownership.
- **Multi-document support**: ID, passport, permits, visas, licenses, health cards.
- **Biometric verification**: Confirms ID ownership with optional video-liveness to prevent spoofing.
- **Manual review option**: High-risk cases routed to trained specialists for 24/7 manual verification.
- **Flexible consent**: SDK or customer-managed consent handling.

## Verdicts

Verdicts for this data block.

| Verdict          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `verified`       | The document and biometric samples (if configured) were successfully processed and data was extracted. Identity verification completed successfully. |
| `fraud_detected` | Fraud was detected on the document or biometric samples (if configured), or they were no longer valid. No identity data is extracted for security reasons. |
| `capture_failed` | The quality of the provided images did not allow for processing. Common causes include blur, glare, poor lighting, or incomplete document visibility. |
| `default`        | A technical or unexpected error occurred during processing. This includes service unavailability, timeouts, or processing failures. |
