#### Transition states of flow sessions

This page explains the lifecycle of a flow session in the Trust Platform, including the available sessionStatus values, what each represents, and how a session transitions between states.

## Sessions

A flow **session** is created when the endpoint `POST /flows/{flowId}/sessions` is called.

Immediately after creation, the initial sessionStatus of the session is `In Progress`.

While the session is `In Progress`, the flow steps are executed and the user proceeds through the journey.

From `In Progress`, a flow session can transition into any of the terminal states described below.

Once a flow session reaches any terminal state, it stops normal step processing and the flow session has ended.

:::info
The `sessionStatus` is included in every `GET /sessions/{sessionId}` response and in all webhook events triggered during an active session.

## Session status

| `sessionStatus` | Entry Condition                                                    | Meaning                                                                                                        | Transitions / Notes                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **In Progress** | Created immediately when `POST /flows/{flowId}/sessions` is called | Flow steps are being executed. User is progressing through the journey. TTL has not expired.                   | Can transition to: `Completed`, `Aborted`, `Expired`, `Error`                    |
| **Completed**   | Session finishes all steps without expiry, abort, or error         | Session ended successfully. Business decision reached.                                                         | Metadata outcome: `Accepted` or `Rejected`. Technical state remains `Completed`. |
| **Aborted**     | User explicitly stops the session via an Abort action              | User intentionally dropped out. No further automated processing occurs.                                        | Cannot be restarted. Represents user-driven termination.                         |
| **Expired**     | TTL reached while session still `In Progress`                      | Session out due to inactivity or incomplete progression.                                                       | Cannot be restarted.                                                             |
| **Error**       | Any step encounters a technical failure                            | Technical failure during execution (system exception, integration failure, etc.). Normal flow cannot continue. | Reflects technical failure, not a business decision.                             |
