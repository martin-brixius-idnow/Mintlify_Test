## What are webhooks?

Webhooks let your application receive **real-time notifications** when events occur during a user’s flow execution. Instead of constantly polling the API, your server is automatically sent an HTTP POST request the moment something changes.

In the TrustPlatform, every action runs as a **flow**, which consists of multiple **nodes**—such as identity checks, document verification, or digital signatures.

Because nodes execute **asynchronously** (depending on user behavior, device performance, and third-party services), your system needs a reliable way to stay informed whenever the flow’s state changes.

## Why webhooks are needed

Webhooks fire whenever a flow transitions to a new state, allowing your backend to react instantly:

- **Flow Created** — a new flow execution record is initialized  
  `<flow_execution.created>`

- **Flow Started** — the user has entered and begun the flow  
  `<flow_execution.started>`

- **Flow Completed** — all required nodes have successfully finished  
  `<flow_execution.completed>`

- **Flow Expired** — the flow reached its TTL without completion  
  `<flow_execution.expired>`

- **Flow Error** — a node failure halted the flow  
  `<flow_execution.error>`

These events keep your system **synchronized, predictable, and responsive**, enabling you to automate reactions, trigger internal workflows, or update UI states—all without ever polling again.
