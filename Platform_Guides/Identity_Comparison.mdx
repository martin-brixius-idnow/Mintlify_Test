title: Identity Comparison
description: Compares identity details from two different sources.
---

## Overview

Ensures the identity information collected from different steps or documents refers to the same person, improving decision accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Dual Source Comparison**: Compares identity data from two different sources
- **Requires Two Distinct DataBlocks**: Requires two distinct BasicIdentity DataBlocks
- **Configurable Attributes**: Allows selection of specific attributes to compare
- **Dual Comparison Modes**: Supports both strict and tolerant comparison modes
- **ComparisonResults Output**: Produces ComparisonResults DataBlock with detailed verdict and traceability
- **Transition Requirement**: flow must define transitions for both `match` and `failure` ports to handle all possible outcomes

## Configuration

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| leftOperand | string | Yes | step ID that produced the first BasicIdentity DataBlock |
| rightOperand | string | Yes | step ID that produced the second BasicIdentity DataBlock |
| attributes | array | Yes | List of BasicIdentity attributes to compare (e.g., familyName, givenName, birthDate). Minimum 1 attribute required. |
| mode | enum | Yes | Comparison mode: `'strict'` or `'tolerant'`. Determines the comparison logic applied. |

**Comparison Mode Details:**

- **strict**: Name comparison requires all words from both names to have "close enough" matches. Date comparison requires the two dates to be exactly the same.
- **tolerant**: Name comparison requires at least one word from the first name to have a "close enough" match in the second name. Date comparison requires year and month to match (day is ignored).

**Input DataBlock Referencing:**

The `leftOperand` and `rightOperand` fields must contain the identifiers (`id`) of the preceding steps that produced the BasicIdentity DataBlocks to be compared. The values must correspond to existing step IDs in the flow. The values of `leftOperand` and `rightOperand` must be different to ensure comparison between two distinct data sources.

## Comparison Logic

| Outcome       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `match`       | All specified attributes in the attributes list were successfully compared according to the configured comparison mode (strict or tolerant), and all values matched. |
| `noMatch`     | At least one pair of compared attribute values did not match based on the configured comparison mode. This verdict takes priority over `inconclusive` if there are also missing attribute values. |
| `inconclusive`| One or more required attribute values are missing, making comparison impossible. No mismatches were detected among the available attributes. |

## Input Data

Input requirements for this step.

| DataBlock Type | Required | Description |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| BasicIdentity | Yes | First BasicIdentity DataBlock (from leftOperand step) |
| BasicIdentity | Yes | Second BasicIdentity DataBlock (from rightOperand step) |

**Important:** This step requires exactly two BasicIdentity DataBlocks as input. The flow validation system ensures that the steps referenced by `leftOperand` and `rightOperand` are predecessors of the comparison step and that each produces a BasicIdentity DataBlock.

## Output Data

DataBlocks produced per verdict.

| Scenario | DataBlocks Produced | Description |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| match | `ComparisonResults` | All specified attributes match between the two BasicIdentity sources |
| failure | `ComparisonResults` | One or more specified attributes do not match or are missing, preventing the expected comparison between the two BasicIdentity sources |
