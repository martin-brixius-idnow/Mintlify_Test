## How it works

Ship identity flows in minutes, not weeks. One authentication. A small, stable set of endpoints. Unlimited identity journeys.

<Note>
The API returns only what you need. No bloat. No unnecessary PII exposure. Request full data when you want it. Ignore it when you don’t.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authenticate once" icon="key">
    Obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token using the `Get /Token` endpoint and reuse it across all flows.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive available flows" icon="list-tree">
    Use `GET /flows` to list all flows configured in your environment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a verification session" icon="play">
    Start a new session with `POST /flows/{flowId}/sessions` and receive a sessionId and sessionToken.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track status and decisions" icon="bolt">
    Poll `GET /session/{sessionId}` to retrieve status, decision outcome, timestamps, and the last executed step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fetch data and files on demand" icon="download">
    Retrieve identity data via `GET /session/{sessionId}/datablocks` and files via `GET /files/{file
Id}` only when needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why developers choose this API

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Privacy by default" icon="lock" color="#10b981">
    Endpoints return decision metadata and data block references, not raw PII. Fetch identity data or files only when needed.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Clear session model" icon="arrows-maximize" color="#3b82f6">
    Flows define logic. Sessions track individual user runs. Start a session, then query its state and result.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Audit-ready by design" icon="route" color="#8b5cf6">
    Sessions expose status, timestamps, subject references, and last executed step for traceability and audits.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Flexible frontends" icon="display" color="#f59e0b">
    Use the same APIs for redirect or embedded Player integrations. Frontend choice does not affect backend logic.
