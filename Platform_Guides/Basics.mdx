# Core Concept

This page explains the core building blocks of the IDnow TrustPlatform and how they work together to form end-to-end flows:

- **Flow**: Overall path from Start node to End node.
- **Nodes**: Steps that process data.
- **Verdicts**: Results of a node (e.g. “verified”, “fraud”).
- **DataBlocks**: Typed data passed between nodes.
- **Ports**: Named paths that decide the next node.

## Flows: From Start to End

At IDnow, a **flow** defines how input data moves through a series of steps until a final output is produced. 

Every flow must contain exactly one **Start node** as its entry point and at least one **End node** representing a final outcome. Between Start and End, you can add any combination of processing steps to build your desired automation.

## Nodes

**Nodes** are modular building blocks within a Trust Platform flow, each representing a single operational step. Typical examples include Identity Verification (IDV), AML Screening, Digital Signals or Electronic Signature.

IDnow provides a comprehensive node library that you can use to construct the automation logic of your flow.

*Every flow starts at Start, passes through one or more nodes, and ends in an End node.*

## Verdicts

Each node can produce one or more **verdicts**, which describe what happened during a flow execution. For an IDV node, defined verdicts are

- `verified`
- `fraud`
- `failure`

In the API response, those verdicts are often accompanied by structured data that explains the result. At the flow level, the verdict of the final End node feeds into the high-level `outcome` you see in the API response (for example, accepted or rejected).

![IDV node with three outcomes: verified, fraud, and failure, each leading to a dedicated End node.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-brixius-idnow/Mintlify_Test/main/images/trustplatform-idv-datablocks-verdicts.png)

*Example of an IDV node with multiple verdicts, each mapped to a dedicated End node.*

## DataBlocks

Each node consumes and produces typed **DataBlocks**. Examples of such DataBlocks could be `ExtendedIdentity`, `DocumentVerification` and `DocumentData`. This keeps data consistent as it moves through the flow. The platform determines which DataBlocks are available at each step, verifies that all required inputs are present, and ensures data dependencies are satisfied before executing a node.

The DataBlock structure is preserved in the API response after a flow runs, making it easy to trace data from the initial input to the final outcome.

### Verdicts and Datablock creation

A node’s verdict determines which DataBlocks it produces. For example, in an IDV workflow, a capture failure produces no DocumentData or ExtendedIdentity, while a capture failure or a fraud verdict always includes DocumentVerification results. Many DataBlocks also carry the node’s verdict to indicate the outcome of the check that generated them.

*An IDV node generates different DataBlocks depending on whether the verdict is verified, fraud, or failure.*

### DataBlocks as Input

Some nodes require specific DataBlocks as input and always produce a particular DataBlock as output. For example, an AML Screening node:

- Requires a `BasicIdentity` DataBlock as input.
- Produces a `PepAndSanctionsResults` DataBlock as output.

![Flow where an IDV node creates a BasicIdentity DataBlock that is used as input for AML Screening, which in turn produces a PepAndSanctionsResults DataBlock.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-brixius-idnow/Mintlify_Test/main/images/trustplatform-aml-screening-match-no-match.png)

*IDV followed by AML Screening: BasicIdentity flows from IDV into AML, which produces PepAndSanctionsResults.*

In many cases, the required input DataBlock is provided in the initial API request when the flow starts, instead of being produced by a previous node.

![AML Screening flow where BasicIdentity comes directly from the API request, and AML produces PepAndSanctionsResults for match and no_match verdicts.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-brixius-idnow/Mintlify_Test/main/images/trustplatform-aml-screening-match-no-match.png)

*AML Screening with BasicIdentity coming from the API request and two possible verdicts: match and no_match, both yielding PepAndSanctionsResults.*

### Missing DataBlocks and Multiple of the Same Type

If a required DataBlock is missing, the node cannot execute. For example, if AML Screening requires `BasicIdentity` but none is present in the workflow context, that node will not run.

In more complex flows, a node may require multiple instances of the same DataBlock type (for example, two `BasicIdentity` DataBlocks for comparison). In such cases, the nodeâ€™s input array contains the same DataBlock type multiple times, with each occurrence representing a separate instance.

When multiple upstream nodes generate DataBlocks of the same type, the platform currently uses the last produced instance.

## Ports and Flow Control

**Ports** define how flows choose their next step. Ports are named exits on a node and determine which path the flow follows. Ports effectively turn node verdicts into transitions:

- If a step ends in the `verified` scenario, the transition with port `"verified"` is taken.
- If a transition has no port, it maps to the default scenario.

A simplified transition object looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "next_node_id",   // Identifier of the target node
  "port": "verified"      // Named port for conditional transitions (e.g., "verified", "failure")
}
```

When a node is configured in Studio with multiple output scenarios, the scenario keys act as port names (for example, `verified`, `fraud_detected`, `capture_failed`, `default`).

## Putting It All Together

A Trust Platform flow is composed of nodes, verdicts, DataBlocks, and ports. When designing a flow:

1. **Define the initial process steps**  
   For example, start with an ID verification node that outputs multiple verdicts (`success`, `fraud`, `capture_failed`) through corresponding ports, each connected to the appropriate next node or End node.

2. **Reuse outputs between nodes**  
   DataBlocks produced by one node can be used as inputs to downstream nodes. For instance, a `BasicIdentity` DataBlock created during ID verification can be passed to an AML Screening node, which then produces its own verdict and `PepAndSanctionsResults` DataBlocks.

3. **Extend the workflow as needed**  
   Add additional nodes for risk checks, digital signals, signatures, or evidence collection. Each node follows the same pattern of verdicts, DataBlocks, and ports.

*By combining nodes, verdicts, DataBlocks, and ports, you can build complex trust workflows in the Trust Platform.*

By understanding these building blocks, you can compose complex trust workflows simply by wiring nodes together. The platform handles execution, data propagation, and audit trails automatically.
