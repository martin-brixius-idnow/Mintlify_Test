## Overview

Workflows are modeled as directed graphs of **nodes** connected by transitions. Nodes are classified into four types: **Start nodes** that initiate workflow execution, **Step nodes** that perform processing, **Decision nodes** that implement conditional branching, and **End nodes** that terminate execution with an outcome status.【82-3】【82-4】

Each node has an `id`, a `type` (matching a grammar word), an `options` object for configuration, and an optional `next` array that defines outgoing transitions.【82-4】【102-19】

## Start

### `START`

The **Start** step represents the entry point of every workflow. There must be exactly one `START` node with id `"START"`, it cannot have incoming transitions, and it must have exactly one outgoing transition.【102-3】

It has no required inputs and can optionally declare initial DataBlocks via the `inputs` option so that subsequent steps can consume pre-existing data without needing a producer step.【102-3】

---

## Step nodes

### `DOC_ID:v1` (deprecated) {#doc_idv1-deprecated}

This step executes a **headless document verification** process using IDCheck.io, based on document images submitted by the customer via the Trust Platform API, without interacting with the end-user. It has been deprecated and replaced by `DOC_ID_HEADLESS:v1`.【100-0】【102-21】

---

### `DOC_ID_HEADLESS:v1` {#doc_id_headlessv1}

`DOC_ID_HEADLESS:v1` performs **document and identity verification in headless mode**, consuming document images (and optionally a biometric sample) provided via the Trust Platform API and delegating analysis, extraction and verification to IDCheck.io according to the configured realm.【100-2】【102-18】【102-39】

It always requires `DocumentImages` as input and may additionally require `BiometricSamples` when biometric processing is enabled in `options`.【100-3】【102-39】

---

### `DOC_ID:v2` {#doc_idv2}

`DOC_ID:v2` orchestrates a **full identity verification flow** that starts with an interactive SDK-Web capture session and ends with backend analysis, potentially including manual review by an agent.【100-6】

Its configuration defines the capture phase, including allowed `documentTypes`, optional `biometricSampleTypes`, and who collects biometric consent via `biometricConsentHandling`.【100-6】【100-7】

---

### `SPHINX:v1.0` {#sphinxv10}

The `SPHINX:v1.0` node integrates the **Sphinx document verification service**, providing automated (AutoIdent) and agent-assisted (VideoIdent) verification methods to help detect fraud and meet compliance requirements.【100-10】

It can optionally use `inputSources` to pre-fill identity data from `BasicIdentity` and `ExtendedIdentity` DataBlocks produced by previous nodes or the `START` node.【100-10】【100-11】

---

### `FRANCE_IDENTITE:v1.0` {#france_identitev10}

`FRANCE_IDENTITE:v1.0` orchestrates a user’s **authentication via the France Identité identity provider** using the OIDC protocol: it redirects the user for authentication and consent, then processes the response to retrieve verified identity attributes.【100-13】【100-14】

The node requires no input DataBlocks or specific configuration options and returns `BasicIdentity`, `ExtendedIdentity` and `AuthenticationResult` on successful authentication.【100-13】【102-45】

---

### `EUDI_WALLET_VERIFIER:v1.0` {#eudi_wallet_verifierv10}

This step orchestrates **verification of user data via EUDI Wallet credential presentations**, implementing OID4VP and mdoc flows to request, receive and verify credentials from the user’s European Digital Identity Wallet.【100-16】

It is configured with `requestedCredentials`, each specifying a credential `type`, `format`, and optional `datablocks` mapping to DSL DataBlocks; on success, it produces `PresentationResult` and any DataBlocks referenced in `datablocks`.【100-16】【100-18】【102-40】

---

### `BIOMETRIC_ENROLLMENT:v1` {#biometric_enrollmentv1}

`BIOMETRIC_ENROLLMENT:v1` manages **facial biometric enrollment** of a user via the Keyless IDV bridge, enabling silent enrollment from images collected by other sources (not necessarily a Keyless SDK).【102-31】

It creates an `AuthenticatorCredential` on successful enrollment and supports retry behavior through the `maxRetries` option.【102-28】

---

### `BIOMETRIC_VERIFICATION:v1` {#biometric_verificationv1}

This step executes a **biometric face verification** process using the Keyless service: it initializes an authentication request, waits for the biometric result signal, and processes the outcome.【102-17】

It consumes a `UserReference` DataBlock (subject identifier) and produces `AuthenticationResult` in both `authenticated` and `failed` scenarios, with a `default` scenario for technical errors.【102-17】

---

### `VERIFICATION_METHOD_SELECTOR:v1` {#verification_method_selectorv1}

`VERIFICATION_METHOD_SELECTOR:v1` displays a **selection page of verification methods** configured by the client, then routes the workflow to the node associated with the chosen method using **dynamic ports** whose names match the configured method identifiers.【102-35】【102-10】

It is a pure routing step: it has no static inputs, produces no DataBlocks, and defines a static `default` port as a fallback for errors, abandonment or timeouts.【102-10】【102-35】

---

### `DEVICE_SIGNALS:v1` {#device_signalsv1}

This node integrates a **device signals service** (such as Fingerprint) to assess device risk and detect fraud indicators like automation, environment manipulation or emulator usage.【102-35】

Configuration options define thresholds (e.g. `suspiciousUserThreshold`, `notTrustedUserThreshold`) used to classify results into scenarios such as `trusted`, `suspicious`, `not_trusted` and `inconclusive`.【102-35】【102-32】

---

### `DIGITAL_SIGNALS:v1` {#digital_signalsv1}

`DIGITAL_SIGNALS:v1` calls a **digital signals provider** to compute a trust assessment based on signals such as IP, email and phone, producing a `DigitalSignals` DataBlock with score, reasons and raw provider response.【82-19】【102-23】【102-32】

It has no mandatory static inputs and uses configuration options (including thresholds and optional `inputSources`) to interpret the provider’s result into scenarios `trusted`, `suspicious`, `not_trusted`, `inconclusive` and a `default` fallback.【102-23】【102-32】【102-36】

---

### `ELECTRONIC_SIGNATURE:v1` {#electronic_signaturev1}

This step orchestrates a **complete electronic signature process** by wrapping a signature provider API (e.g. InstantSign): it validates inputs (including document expiry for QES), builds provider API calls, manages the end-user session and outputs a `SignedDocumentsPackage`.【102-12】

Its configuration centers on `signingConfiguration`, including `signatureLevel` (such as QES or AES), which must match what is enabled and configured at the provider.【102-12】

---

### `BASIC_IDENTITY_COMPARISON:v1` {#basic_identity_comparisonv1}

`BASIC_IDENTITY_COMPARISON:v1` compares **two `BasicIdentity` DataBlocks** and produces a `ComparisonResults` DataBlock describing attribute-level matches, mismatches and missing data.【102-38】

Options specify which attributes to compare and the comparison `mode` (`strict` or `tolerant`), while outputs use two ports: `match` when all specified attributes match and `failure` otherwise.【102-38】【102-49】

---

### `PEP_AND_SANCTIONS:v1` {#pep_and_sanctionsv1}

This step executes an **AML screening** of an identity against PEP and sanctions lists using `BasicIdentity` data (last name, first name, date of birth).【102-22】

It has a single `default` scenario that always produces `PepAndSanctionsResults`, making its output deterministic.【102-22】

---

## Decision node

### `CHOICE` {#choice-decision}

The **Decision** node (`CHOICE`) represents a conditional branching point: it evaluates configured conditions over DataBlock fields and routes execution to different ports such as `success` or `failure`.【102-26】【102-41】

Its `options.choices` array defines condition sets and their `then` ports, and a mandatory `default` port is used when no choice matches, ensuring that every evaluation has a valid outcome.【102-26】【102-20】

---

## End node

### `END` {#end}

The **End** step terminates a workflow execution path and emits an `OutcomeStatus` via its `default` output scenario, but it has no outgoing transitions.【102-30】

Its `options.outcome` (or `outcomeStatus` in examples) classifies the termination (for example `accepted` or `rejected`), and validation enforces that `END` nodes have no `next` transitions.【102-30】
