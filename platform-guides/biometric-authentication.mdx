title: Authentication
description: Authenticates identity using facial recognition
---

Used when strong, real‑time identity confirmation is required. The user completes a quick face scan, and the system ensures they are a real person and match the enrolled face, helping prevent impersonation, spoofing, and deepfakes.

---

## Key features

- **Signal waiting**: Waits for a signal containing the authentication result.
- **Result processing**: Once the signal is received, it computes the final authentication result by verifying the transaction or processing failure information.

This step requires previous enrollment and uses the captured biometric data to authenticate the user.

---

## Configuration

This step requires no configuration options. It uses the Third Party configuration parameters defined on the infrastructure level.

| --------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UserReference` | Yes       | Contains the unique subject identifier (subjectId) necessary to identify the user in the Keyless system. |

## Verdicts

Verdicts for this data block.

| Scenario        | Description                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authenticated` | Biometric authentication succeeded. The user has been successfully authenticated.                          |
| `failed`        | Biometric authentication failed. This can be due to biometric mismatch, capture error, or technical issue. |
