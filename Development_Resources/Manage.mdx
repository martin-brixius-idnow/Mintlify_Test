## Overview

API keys are used to securely authenticate your client applications with Trustplatform. Each API key consists of a **Public key ID** and a **Client secret** that work together to authenticate your API requests.

You can create multiple API keys for different applications or environments, assign specific permissions to each key, and manage them through the IDnow Studio settings interface.

> **Never share client secrets with anyone. Do not store API keys in version control.**

## Access API key management

To manage your API keys:

1. Log in to your Studio.
2. Navigate to **Settings** in the left sidebar.
3. Under the **DEVELOPER** section, select **API keys**.

![API keys management interface showing the list of existing API keys](images/Resources/API_Keys-Overview.png)

The API keys page displays:
- **Environments**: Your available environments (Live, Staging, Draft) with their respective API endpoints
- **API keys**: A list of all existing API keys with their names, creation details, and usage information

## Create an API key

To create a new API key:

1. From the **API keys** page, select **New API key**.
2. In the **Create API key** dialog, enter a descriptive **API key name** (for example, "Mobile app", "Web client", or "Integration Partner Name").

### Configure permissions

3. Under **Permissions**, select the required permissions for this API key:

| Permission | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Execute flows** | Allows the API key to initiate and execute identity verification flows |
| **Read API resources** | Allows the API key to retrieve data from the API |
| **Edit and create API resources** | Allows the API key to modify and create new resources via the API |

> Select only the permissions that your application needs. This follows the principle of least privilege for better security.

4. Select **Create API key**.

### Save your credentials

5. The **API key created** dialog displays your credentials:
   - **Public key ID**: Use this to identify your API key
   - **Client secret**: Use this together with the Public key ID to authenticate

6. Copy both values using the copy icons and store them securely in your system.

> **Make sure to copy the client secret now. You won't be able to see it again.**
>
> If you lose the client secret, you will need to regenerate it, which will require updating all applications using this API key.

7. Check the confirmation box **I have saved these credentials**.
8. Select **Confirm**.

Your new API key is now ready to use and will appear in the API keys list.

## View API key details

The API keys list shows important information about each credential:

- **API key name**: The descriptive name you assigned
- **Creator and creation date**: Who created the API key and when (for example, "Created 2 months ago by Bob Michaels")
- **Last used**: When the API key was last used for authentication (for example, "Last used 1 day ago")
- **Actions**:
  - **View details**: Opens the edit dialog
  - **Delete icon**: Removes the API key

This information helps you track and audit API key usage across your organization.

## Edit an API key

You can edit the name, permissions, and regenerate the client secret of an existing API key.

To edit an API key:

1. From the API keys list, locate the API key you want to modify.
2. Select **View details**.
3. In the **Edit API key** dialog, you can:
   - Update the **API key name**
   - View the **Public key ID** (read-only, with copy functionality)
   - See the masked **Client secret** (for security, the actual value is hidden)
   - Modify **Permissions** by checking or unchecking the available options
   - **Regenerate** the client secret if needed

![Edit API key dialog showing editable fields and permissions](images/Resources/API_Keys-Edit.png)

4. After making your changes, select **Save changes**.
5. To cancel without saving, select **Cancel**.

> The **Public key ID** cannot be changed. It remains constant throughout the API key's lifecycle.

## Regenerate client secret

If you need to change your client secret for security reasons (for example, if it may have been compromised), you can regenerate it.

To regenerate the client secret:

1. From the **Edit API key** dialog, select **Regenerate** next to the Client secret field.
2. In the **Rotate client secret?** confirmation dialog, review the warning message.

> **Important**: This will immediately revoke access for any application using the old client secret. You have to update all client applications using this API key.

3. If you're ready to proceed, select **Regenerate client secret**. Otherwise, select **Cancel**.

![Regenerate client secret confirmation and updated credentials](images/Resources/API_Keys-Regenerate.png)

4. The **Client secret updated** dialog displays:
   - **Public key ID (unchanged)**: Your Public key ID remains the same
   - **Client secret**: Your new client secret

5. Copy the new client secret using the copy icon and store it securely.

> **Make sure to copy the client secret now. You won't be able to see it again.**

6. Check the confirmation box **I have saved these credentials**.
7. Select **Confirm**.
8. Update all applications using this API key with the new client secret.

The old client secret is immediately revoked and cannot be used for authentication.

## Delete an API key

Deleting an API key permanently removes it and immediately revokes access for any application using that credential.

To delete an API key:

1. From the API keys list, locate the API key you want to delete.
2. Select the **Delete icon** (trash can).
3. In the **Delete API key?** confirmation dialog, review the warning message:
   - The API key name is displayed for confirmation
   - Warning: "This will immediately revoke access for any application using this API key. You will not be able to recover this API key later."

4. If you're certain you want to delete the API key, select **Delete API key**. Otherwise, select **Cancel**.

![Delete API key confirmation dialog](images/Resources/API_Keys-Delete.png)

> **This action cannot be undone.** Make sure to update or disable all applications using this API key before deletion to avoid service disruptions.

The API key is immediately deleted and can no longer be used to authenticate API requests.

## Security best practices

### Credential storage
- **Never share client secrets** with anyone
- **Do not store API keys in version control** (Git, SVN, etc.)
- Use environment variables or secure credential management systems
- Store credentials in encrypted password managers or secret management services

### Access control
- Grant only the minimum permissions required for each API key
- Remove permissions that are no longer needed

### Monitoring and maintenance
- Monitor the **Last used** timestamp to identify inactive API keys
- Delete API keys that are no longer in use
- Regenerate client secrets periodically as part of your security policy

### Environment separation
- Use separate API keys for each environment (Live, Staging, Draft)
- Never use production (Live) credentials in development or testing environments
- Test credential rotation procedures in Draft or Staging before applying to Live
