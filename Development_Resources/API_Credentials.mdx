API keys securely authenticate your client applications with Trust Platform. Each key has a **Public key ID** and a **Client secret**. You can create multiple keys, assign permissions, and manage them in the IDnow dashboard.

> **Never share client secrets. Do not store API keys in version control.**

1. Log in to the IDnow dashboard at [hub.hub.dev.eu.idnow.io](https://hub.hub.dev.eu.idnow.io/auth/login).
