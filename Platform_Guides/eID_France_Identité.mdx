## Key Features

- ***OIDC-based Authentication***: Secure authentication using France Identité via OpenID Connect.
- ***Seamless Redirection***: Redirects users to France Identité for login and returns them post-authentication.

## Verdicts

Verdicts for this DataBlock.

| Verdict | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `verified` | The user's identity has been successfully authenticated by the France Identité wallet. The user has consented to sharing their data, and the OIDC flow has completed with the reception of an ID Token containing the verified attributes. |
| `canceled` | The user actively interrupted the process. This can occur either by explicitly cancelling the authentication or by refusing to grant consent at the data sharing step. |
| `not_verified` | The authentication attempt failed. The identity could not be verified because the user failed to authenticate with their wallet (e.g., by entering an incorrect PIN). |
