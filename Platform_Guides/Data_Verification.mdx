title: Headless Verification
---

## Overview

The node performs headless document verification that processes pre-captured document and biometric data. It validates document authenticity and extracts identity information from documents without user interaction during the step execution.

---

## Characteristics

- **Headless Processing**: Processes pre-captured data without user interaction during step execution
- **Consent Required**: Requires BiometricSamples with `consent = true`
- **Document Validation**: Validates document authenticity
- **Identity Extraction**: Extracts identity information from documents

## Configuration Options

|  Parameter            | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| biometricProcessing          | object | A container for parameters related to biometric verification. If this object is not provided, no biometric analysis is performed. The IDCheck.io realm configuration must be aligned with the options set in this step. |
| biometricProcessing.sampleType | enum   | Defines the type of biometric sample provided. Currently, only the value `SELFIE` is supported.                                                                    |

## Types of Input Data

Input requirements for this node.

| DataBlock Type | Required | Description |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| `DocumentImages` | Yes | Pre-captured document images (front and/or back side) |
| `BiometricSamples` | Yes | Pre-captured biometric data with `consent = true` |

If the consent field in the BiometricSamples DataBlock is set to true, Idnow will not ask the user for consent. This indicates that the client has already obtained valid user consent prior to submitting the data for processing. If the field is set to false, the iframe will prompt the user to provide consent.

## Types of Output Data

DataBlocks produced per verdict.

| Scenario | DataBlocks Produced | Description |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| verified | `BasicIdentity`, `ExtendedIdentity`, `DocumentData`, `DocumentImages`, `DocumentVerification`, `BiometricSamples` | Successful document processing with identity extraction |
| fraud_detected | `DocumentVerification` | Document identified as fraudulent |
| capture_failed | `DocumentVerification` | Document capture failed |
| default | `DocumentVerification` | Unexpected or technical error during processing |
