description: Cryptographic identity verification using national electronic identity cards with attestation
---

## Overview

Secure identity verification leveraging national electronic identity card infrastructure. Validates identity data through cryptographic attestation using pre-configured certificate chains, ensuring authenticity directly from eID cards without relying solely on visual document inspection.

---

## Key Features

- **Cryptographic Attestation** - Certificate chain validation for tamper-proof verification
- **National eID Support** - Compatible with electronic identity card standards
- **Cross-Validation** - Compare attestation data against other workflow steps
- **Flexible Input Mapping** - Configure which steps provide identity data for comparison
- **Multi-Output Support** - Produces verified identity and document data
- **Fraud Prevention** - Detects invalid attestation attempts

## Configuration

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `inputSources` | Object | No | - | Maps identity data sources to workflow step IDs for pre-filling the session |
| `shortname` | String | No | - | Managed at the credential configuration level on the platform |

## Input

Input requirements for this node.

| DataBlock          | Mandatory | Description                                          |
|--------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `BasicIdentity`    | No      | BasicIdentity data to compare against attestation    |
| `ExtendedIdentity` | No      | ExtendedIdentity data to compare against attestation |

*If the DataBlock is not available, the node will execute normally without this information, and the workflow will proceed without error.

## Verdicts

Verdicts for this DataBlock.

| Verdict | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `verified` | Successful document processing with identity extraction. User's documents were successfully verified, either automatically or by an agent. |
| `fraud_detected` | Document identified as fraudulent. This occurs when fraud is confirmed after manual review. No identity data is extracted. |
| `aborted` | The user aborted the journey or the session expired. No data is extracted. |
| `cancelled` | The verification process was cancelled by the agent, for instance due to blurry images or unusable documents. |
| `default` | Unexpected or technical error occurred during processing. This includes service unavailability or processing failures. |

## Output

DataBlocks produced per verdict.

| Verdict | DataBlocks Produced | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| **verified** | `BasicIdentity`, `ExtendedIdentity`, `BiometricSamples`, `DocumentData`, `DocumentImages`, `DocumentVerification` | All identity data successfully extracted |
| **fraud_detected** | `DocumentVerification` | Contains fraud detection details |
| **aborted** | - | No DataBlocks produced |
| **cancelled** | `DocumentVerification` | Contains cancellation reason |
| **default** | - | No DataBlocks produced |
