title: Introduction
description: Receive real-time event notifications when flows execute.
---

Webhooks deliver **real-time notifications** to your application when events occur during a flow execution. Instead of polling the API, your server automatically receives an HTTP POST request the moment something changes.

In the TrustPlatform, every action runs as a **flow** and a series of **nodes** like a identity verification or digital signatures. Because nodes execute **asynchronously** (based on user behavior, device performance, and third-party services), webhooks keep your system synchronized with the flow's current state.

<Info>
**Key characteristics:**
- Thin payloads only (never contains PII)
- All events sent by default
- Asynchronous delivery (order not guaranteed)
- Automatic retries for transient failures
</Info>

## Webhook Lifecycle

The webhook system operates in four phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Phase">
    Configure your webhook endpoint in Studio
  </Step>
  <Step title="Runtime Phase">
    Events are generated and delivered as flows execute
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Handling">
    Your endpoint validates, processes, and acknowledges events
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retry & Monitoring">
    Failed deliveries are retried; all attempts are logged
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration Checklist

Before receiving webhooks, complete these steps:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Expose a secure HTTPS endpoint" icon="lock" defaultOpen="true">
    Your endpoint must support **TLS 1.2 or higher** for receiving POST requests.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="2. Allowlist official IDnow IP ranges" icon="shield-check">
    Block unauthorized sources by accepting requests only from documented IDnow IPs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="3. Enable JWT signature verification (recommended)" icon="key">
    Use our signed JTW to verify webhook authenticity and prevent spoofing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="4. Respond with HTTP 2xx within 10 seconds" icon="bolt">
    Return a success status quickly and process events asynchronously in the background.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="5. Use event_id for idempotency" icon="fingerprint">
    Track `event_id` to detect and skip duplicate deliveries caused by retries.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
These steps ensure reliable delivery, secure processing, and smooth integration.
