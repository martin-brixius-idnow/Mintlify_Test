---

IDnow sends webhook events for different stages of a session. Each event provides information about the current state of the configured flow journey.

:::info
All events use thin payloads. No personally identifiable information (PII) is included by default.

## Payload structure

All webhook events share a common structure:

| Field            | Type     | Description                                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `eventId`        | String   | Same ID across retries for the same event                                            |
| `eventVersion`   | String   | Current event version                                                                |
| `eventName`      | String   | Format: `resource.action`                                                            |
| `eventDeliverId` | String   | Unique per retry attempt (sequence: 1, 2, 3)                                         |
| `createdAt`      | ISO 8601 | When the webhook was sent                                                            |
| `flowId`         | String   | The identifier of the flow that was triggered                                        |
| `sessionId`      | UUID     | The identifier of the specific session                                               |
| `sessionStatus`  | Enum     | Current status of the flow                                                           |
| `lastStepId`     | String   | Identifier of the last executed step, ID is defined by you in the step configuration |
| `lastStepType`   | String   | Name of the last executed step                                                       |
| `lastStepStatus` | String   | Status of the last executed step (e.g., Aborted)                                     |

:::info
The `eventId` remains the same across all retry attempts, while `eventDeliverId` increments.

## Session events

IDnow sends the following event types when a session changes state:

| Event Type        | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| session.created   | Flow is initialized and ready to start              |
| session.completed | Flow ends with final outcome                        |
| session.expired   | Flow expiry TTL reached, no longer usable           |
| session.aborted   | Flow ends by user interaction with no final outcome |
| session.error     | Flow enters ERROR state and stops processing        |

## Payloads examples

All webhook payloads are a minimal, machine-readable JSON message that delivers metadata about an event and will never include any PII. You can fetch full details from the API when needed by using the respective `session_id`.

### `session.created`

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8",
  "eventName": "session.created",
  "eventVersion": "123",
  "eventDeliverId": "1",
  "createdAt": "2025-11-24T10:15:30.123Z",
  "payload": {
    "flowId": "d08d589a-4f3b-4e9a-8c21-7a9b3f2e1d32",
    "sessionId": "d08d589a-4f3b-4e9a-8c21-7a9b3f2e1d6e",
    "sessionStatus": "CREATED"
  }
}
```

### `session.completed`

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0",
  "eventName": "session.completed",
  "eventVersion": "123",
  "eventDeliveryId": "1",
  "createdAt": "2025-11-24T10:18:45.789Z",
  "payload": {
    "flowId": "identity_verification_v2",
    "sessionId": "d08d589a-4f3b-4e9a-8c21-7a9b3f2e1d6c",
    "sessionStatus": "COMPLETED",
    "lastStepId": "My step",
    "lastStepType": "END",
    "lastStepStatus": "COMPLETED"
  }
}
```

### `session.expired`

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2",
  "eventName": "session.expired",
  "eventVersion": "123",

  "createdAt": "2025-11-24T11:15:30.654Z",
  "payload": {
    "flowId": "identity_verification_v2",
    "sessionId": "f20f701c-6h5d-6g1c-0e43-9c1d5h4g3f8e",
    "sessionStatus": "EXPIRED",
    "lastStepId": "My step",
    "lastStepType": "DOC_ID:v2",
