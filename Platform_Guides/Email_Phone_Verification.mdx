title: Email & Phone Verification 
description: 
---

## Overview

This node assesses user trust level based on various signals determined based on email address, telephone number, IP address, and names. It computes a trust score and routes the workflow based on configurable thresholds.

---

## Key Features

- Computes a ***trust score*** from email, phone, IP and name signals.
- Routes flow using ***configurable thresholds***: suspiciousUserThreshold and trustedUserThreshold.
- ***Optional inputSources*** to specify step IDs (basicIdentity, extendedIdentity, deviceSignals); otherwise uses latest DataBlocks.
- ***Produces DigitalSignals*** for trusted, suspicious, and not_trusted; inconclusive when no definitive assessment.

## Configuration

| Parameter                     | Type    | Required | Default | Description |
|------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `suspiciousUserThreshold`    | Integer | Yes      |         | The score threshold (in percent) below which a user is considered "suspicious". |
| `trustedUserThreshold`       | Integer | Yes      |         | The score threshold (in percent) above which a user is considered "trusted". |
| `inputSources`               | Object  | No       |         | Specifies the workflow step IDs to use for sourcing data. If omitted, the node will use the latest available datablocks from the workflow. |
| `inputSources.basicIdentity` | String  | No       |         | The step ID providing basic identity data (e.g., first name, last name). |
| `inputSources.extendedIdentity` | String | No     |         | The step ID providing extended identity data (e.g., phone, email). |
| `inputSources.deviceSignals` | String  | No       |         | The step ID providing device signal data (e.g., IP address). |

---

## Input Data

If the input sources are not specified, the node attempts to retrieve the information directly from the execution context. In other words, it will fetch the latest available datablocks (`BasicIdentity`, `ExtendedIdentity`, and `DeviceSignals` if they exist).

---

## Verdicts

Verdicts for this DataBlock.

| Verdict       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `trusted`     | The score computed is greater than or equal to trustedUserThreshold. |
| `suspicious`  | The score computed is less than or equal to suspiciousUserThreshold. |
| `not_trusted` | The score computed is between suspiciousUserThreshold and trustedUserThreshold. |
| `inconclusive`| The provider cannot compute a definitive score or assessment. |

## Output Data

DataBlocks produced per verdict.

| Verdict        | DataBlocks Produced | Notes |
|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **trusted**    | `DigitalSignals`    |       |
| **suspicious** | `DigitalSignals`    |       |
| **not_trusted**| `DigitalSignals`    |       |
| **inconclusive**|                     |       |
