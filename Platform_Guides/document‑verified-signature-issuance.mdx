title: Document‑Verified Signature Issuance
description: Verify a user’s identity and generate a compliant electronic signature in one guided flow
---

Combines document‑based identity verification with electronic signature issuance in a single, seamless process.

This step is used when identity data is not yet available at the time of signing. The user first completes document‑based IDV — capturing identity documents, performing biometric checks, and validating liveness. Once verification is successful, the verified identity data is automatically applied to issue the electronic signature within the same session. 

Document‑Verified Signature Issuance supports both QES and AES signatures under eIDAS and AML regulations. It provides an integrated user experience that moves smoothly from verification to signing, ensuring a high level of identity assurance while maintaining a guided, compliant process flow.
