description: Configure your webhook endpoint to receive real-time events.
---

## Expose an Endpoint

Your endpoint must support HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ and return HTTP 2xx within 10 seconds.

<Warning>
HTTP endpoints are **not supported**. HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate is required.
</Warning>

**Requirements:**

| Requirement | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Protocol** | HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ |
| **Response time** | Return 2xx within 10 seconds |
| **Capacity** | Handle expected event volume |
| **Idempotency** | Process duplicates safely using event_id |

<Tip>
Return 2xx **immediately**, then process events asynchronously to avoid timeouts.
</Tip>

## Configure in Studio

Set up your webhook endpoint in the IDnow Studio UI.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Go to **Settings** then **Webhooks** in Studio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add endpoint URL">
    Enter your HTTPS endpoint URL and description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set secret key">
    Provide a secret key for JWT signature verification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscribe to events">
    Select specific events or receive all events by default.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Configure separate endpoints for **test**, **preprod**, and **live** environments.
</Info>

## Handle Webhooks

### Verify the Source

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Validate IP address" icon="network-wired">
    Accept requests only from IDnow's documented IP ranges.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify JWT signature" icon="key">
    Use your secret key to validate the JWT in the request header. See the Security page for details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Process the Event

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check for duplicates">
    Use event_id to detect already-processed events.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return 2xx immediately">
    Respond within 10 seconds to acknowledge receipt.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Queue for processing">
    Add the event to a background queue.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Handle Retries

IDnow retries failed deliveries automatically.

**Retry schedule:**

- Maximum attempts: 5 times
- Intervals: 1min, 5min, 15min, 1hour, 6hours

<Warning>
Implement idempotency using event_id to handle duplicate deliveries from retries.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not receiving webhooks" icon="inbox">
    Check HTTPS accessibility, firewall rules, TLS certificate, and Studio configuration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timeout errors" icon="clock">
    Return 2xx within 10 seconds. Move processing to background queue.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="High retry rates" icon="rotate">
    Check response time, error logs, and server capacity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Duplicate events" icon="copy">
    Expected behavior. Use event_id for idempotency and return 200 OK.
