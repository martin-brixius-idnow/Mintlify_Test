title: Integration
description: Five endpoints. Zero friction. Ship identity flows in minutes.
---

Ship identity flows in minutes, not weeks. One authentication. A small, stable set of endpoints. Unlimited identity journeys.

:::note
The API returns only what you need. No bloat. No unnecessary PII exposure. Request full data when you want it. Ignore it when you don’t.
:::

#### Integration Steps

1. **Authenticate once**: Obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token using the `Get /Token` endpoint and reuse it across all flows.

2. **Receive available flows**: Use `GET /flows` to list all flows configured in your environment.

3. **Create a verification session**: Start a new session with `POST /flows/{flowId}/sessions` and receive a sessionId and sessionToken.

4. **Track status and decisions**: Poll `GET /session/{sessionId}` to retrieve status, decision outcome, timestamps, and the last executed step.

5. **Fetch data and files on demand**: Retrieve identity data via `GET /session/{sessionId}/datablocks` and files via `GET /files/{file
Id}` only when needed.

## Why developers choose this API

#### Privacy by default

Endpoints return decision metadata and data block references, not raw PII. Fetch identity data or files only when needed.

#### Clear session model

Sessions track individual user flows. First, start a session, then query for its result.

#### Audit-ready by design

Session provides a clear audit trail across individual workflow steps, including detailed results for document-based IDV, enabling full traceability and audit support.

#### Flexible frontends

Use the same APIs for redirect or embedded integrations. Frontend choice does not affect backend logic
