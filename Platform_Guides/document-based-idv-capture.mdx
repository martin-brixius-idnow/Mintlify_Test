title: Capture
description: End-to-end, compliant document-based identity verification
---

Verifies identity using secure identity documents through multiple verification modes, adapted to business and regulatory needs.

In Capture mode, the end user completes verification through the IDnow frontend, which guides them step by step in providing the required identity evidence. This includes capturing document images, performing biometric checks (such as face matching and liveness detection), and optionally reading electronic document chips via NFC. The IDnow frontend ensures high-quality image capture, proper lighting checks, and guided user interaction, while maintaining a compliant and user-friendly verification experience.

This contrasts with the Headless approach, where customers collect document and biometric data within their own frontend and submit it to IDnow via API for verification. In Capture mode, IDnow takes full responsibility for the evidence collection process, optimizing data quality and regulatory compliance.

Users can complete verification through automated visual verification (AI-driven document and security feature checks), automated NFC verification (secure chip reading for eID-supported documents), or agent-assisted verification (review by trained identity specialists). Each mode ensures compliance with regulations such as eIDAS, AML, GwG, and BaFin. Configurations are modular, enabling flexible integration across fully automated or hybrid identity verification flows.

## Configuration

| Parameter      | Type   | Required | Default | Description                                                             |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inputSources` | Object | No       | -       | Maps identity data sources to flow step IDs for pre-filling the session |
| `shortname`    | String | No       | -       | Managed at the credential configuration level on the platform           |

## Input data blocks

Input requirements for this step.


| Data block          | Mandatory | Description                                          |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `BasicIdentity`    | No        | BasicIdentity data to compare against attestation    |
| `ExtendedIdentity` | No        | ExtendedIdentity data to compare against attestation |

\*If the Data block is not available, the step will execute normally without this information, and the flow will proceed without error.

| Verdict          | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `verified`       | Successful document processing with identity extraction. User's documents were successfully verified, either automatically or by an agent. |
| `fraud_detected` | Document identified as fraudulent. This occurs when fraud is confirmed after manual review. No identity data is extracted.                 |
| `cancelled`      | The verification process was cancelled by the agent, for instance due to blurry images or unusable documents.                              |
