## Overview

Workflows are modeled as directed graphs of **nodes** connected by transitions. Nodes fall into four types:

- **Start nodes** initiate workflow execution.
- **Step nodes** perform processing.
- **Decision nodes** implement conditional branching.
- **End nodes** terminate execution with an outcome status.

Each node has an `id`, a `type` (matching a grammar word), an `options` object for configuration, and an optional `next` array that defines outgoing transitions.

## Node catalog

Use this table as a clickable index. Each link jumps to the detailed section for the node.
