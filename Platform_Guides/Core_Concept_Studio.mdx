description: Visual flow builder for creating identity verification workflows
---

Trustplatform Studio provides a visual flow builder for creating identity verification workflows. Flows are the building blocks of your verification process, allowing you to orchestrate multiple verification steps, handle different outcomes, and create sophisticated user journeysâ€”all without writing code.

## Getting Started

### Access Flows

After selecting your organization, navigate to **Flows** from the sidebar. This view displays all flows within your organization, their current status (Draft, Staging, or Live), and last update time.

### Create a New Flow

Click **Create Flow +** to initialize a new flow. Provide the following:

- **Name**: A descriptive identifier for your flow (e.g., "Onboarding KYC Flow" or "Re-authentication Flow")
- **Description**: Additional context about the flow's purpose and use case

<Tip>
Use clear naming conventions that indicate the flow's purpose and target use case. This is especially important when managing multiple flows across different products or user segments.
</Tip>

### Open the Flow Editor

Navigate to the **Versions** tab. Each flow starts with a default `v1` version in Draft status. 

1. Click **Edit or publish** dropdown
2. Select **Open in editor** to access the visual flow builder

## Building Your Flow

### Default Nodes

The editor automatically creates two essential nodes:

- **Session started**: The entry point where users begin verification
- **Session completed**: Terminal nodes that determine the final outcome (accept/reject)

<Note>
These nodes cannot be deleted and serve as the boundaries of your verification flow. Every flow must have a clear path from the start node to at least one end node.
</Note>

### Add Nodes

Click **Add node** to browse available verification methods:

| Node Type | Technical Name | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Biometric authentication | `biometric_verification` | Face matching and liveness detection |
| Verify identity with document | - | ID document scanning and verification |
| Check political exposure and sanctions | `pep_and_sanctions` | AML/PEP screening |
| Choose verification method | `method_selector` | Let users select their preferred method |
| Decision | `choice` | Create conditional logic based on custom rules |
| Contract Signing | `electronic_signature` | Collect digital signatures |
| Device information | `device_signals` | Capture device fingerprinting data |
| Email, Phone & IP Signals | `digital_signals` | Additional identity signals |

Each node represents a specific capability within the Trust Platform. Nodes are modular and can be combined to create complex workflows tailored to your compliance and security requirements.

### Configure Node Ports

After adding a node, map its output ports to define routing based on verification outcomes.

**Example: Biometric Authentication node outputs**

- **If authenticated**: User's face matches the document photo and liveness is confirmed
- **If failed**: Verification failed (no match, liveness check failed, or technical error)
- **Else**: Catch-all for unexpected outcomes or errors

<Warning>
Map each port to the next node or to a terminal end node. Unmapped ports will prevent you from publishing the flow, as every possible outcome must have a defined path.
</Warning>

### Configure Node Options

Click **Options** on any node to access step-level configuration parameters. These settings vary by node type and control individual verification behavior.

**Common configuration options:**

- **Threshold scores**: Minimum confidence levels required for acceptance
- **Data collection**: Additional fields or documents to collect
- **Retry policies**: Number of attempts users get before failing

These parameters let you fine-tune each step without modifying the overall flow structure, enabling reuse of flow templates across different use cases with varying risk tolerances.

### Test with Preview Mode

Before publishing, use **Launch preview** to test the complete user experience.

**Preview mode allows you to:**

- Walk through the flow as an end user
- Verify that all routing logic works correctly
- Validate UI/UX elements and branding

<Tip>
Preview sessions are isolated and don't affect production metrics or compliance reporting. Use this feature liberally during development to catch issues early.
</Tip>

## Publishing and Deployment

### Version Management

Flows support three deployment stages:

| Stage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Draft** | Work-in-progress versions for development and testing |
| **Staging** | Pre-production testing with production-like data |
| **Live** | Active flows serving real user traffic |

To promote a flow version, use the **Edit or publish** dropdown in the Versions tab. Publish to Staging first for final validation before promoting to Live.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic flow and iterate based on real-world performance data
2. **Handle All Outcomes**: Ensure every node has all ports mapped to prevent dead ends
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Label nodes clearly to make flows self-documenting
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Use preview mode extensively before publishing to production
5. **Version Strategically**: Create new versions for significant changes while preserving the previous stable version
