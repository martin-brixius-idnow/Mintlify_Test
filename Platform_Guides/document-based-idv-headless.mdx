#### Automated verification using pre‑captured document and face images

Verifies identity using static evidence collected by the your own front end and submitted to IDnow via API.

In Headless mode, your application is responsible for collecting and providing identity evidence, such as images of the ID document and a selfie image of the user. IDnow then performs verification on these static inputs using AI-based analysis and data extraction modules. Unlike Capture mode, the Headless flow does not involve any user interaction within the IDnow front end; all evidence is provided directly by the customer’s system.

Because verification relies solely on static images, certain checks that require dynamic interaction or live capture cannot be performed. These include NFC chip reading and dynamic document validation (for example, visual inspection of holograms under movement or live liveness actions). As a result, Headless verification provides a more limited level of accuracy compared to Capture mode and is not suitable for regulated use cases such as KYC or AML processes.

Instead, Headless mode is best suited for unregulated scenarios, such as document data extraction, image quality assessment, or pre-validation steps where full dynamic verification is not required.

## Key features

- **_Customer-managed evidence collection_** – The customer application captures and submits document and selfie images via API.
- **_Static evidence processing_** – Verification is performed using only static images, without live interaction or dynamic capture.
- **_AI-based analysis_** – Automated checks assess document authenticity, extract data, and compare facial features between the document and the selfie.
- **_Lightweight integration_** – Ideal for API-based use cases that require automated data extraction or streamlined verification flows.

## Configuration

| Parameter                      | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| biometricProcessing            | object       | A container for biometric verification parameters. If omitted, no biometric analysis is performed. The IDCheck.io realm configuration must match the options set here. |
| biometricProcessing.sampleType | string, enum | Specifies the biometric sample type. Currently, only `SELFIE` is supported.                                                                                            |

## Input data blocks

Input requirements for this step.

| Data block type    | Required    | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DocumentImages`   | Yes         | Contains the S3 URLs of the identity document images. This data block is always required.                                          |
| `BiometricSamples` | Conditional | Contains the S3 URLs of the face of the end-user. This data block is required only if the `biometricProcessing` option is present. |
