## Authentication

Idnow signs all webhook events with a JWT signature. You can verify this signature to ensure the webhook came from Idnow.

### API Token

You provide an API token when configuring your webhook endpoint in Studio. Idnow includes this token in the request header.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your API token">
    Configure your API token in Studio when setting up the webhook endpoint.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify the token">
    Check the token in the request header matches your expected value.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### JWT Signature

All webhook payloads are signed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). You can optionally verify the signature to confirm authenticity.

The JWT signature is included in the `X-Idnow-Signature` header with every webhook request.

<Info>
JWT signature verification is optional but recommended for production environments.
</Info>

## IP Whitelisting

Restrict your webhook endpoint to only accept requests from Idnow IP addresses.

<Info>
Idnow maintains a limited and stable list of IP addresses for webhook delivery.
</Info>

### IP Ranges

Add these IP ranges to your firewall or application allow list:

```text
203.0.113.0/24
198.51.100.0/24
192.0.2.0/24
```

<Note>
Contact your account manager for the current production IP ranges.
</Note>

## TLS Requirements

Your webhook endpoint must support TLS 1.2 or higher. Idnow validates your endpoint's TLS configuration during setup.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="TLS 1.2" icon="check">
    Supported and recommended
  </Card>
  <Card title="TLS 1.3" icon="check">
    Supported and recommended
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security Headers

Idnow includes these headers with every webhook request:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Authorization` | Your API token |
| `X-Idnow-Signature` | JWT signature of the payload |
| `Content-Type` | Always `application/json` |
| `User-Agent` | Idnow webhook service identifier |
