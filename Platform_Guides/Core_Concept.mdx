description: Flows, steps, verdicts and data blocks.

This page explains the core building blocks of the IDnow Trust Platform and how they work together to form end-to-end flows:

- **Flow**: A flow that runs from start to end and defines the operational steps leading to a final outcome.
- **Start and end step**: The flow ends in an End step that determines whether the outcome is accepted or rejected.
- **Steps**: A Step performs an operational step that reads inputs, writes data blocks, and produces a verdict.
- **Verdicts**: A verdict defines the Step’s result and determines the output data blocks and the next routing step (e.g., `"verified"`, `"fraud"`).
- **Data blocks**: Typed payloads that act as inputs or outputs of a step depending on its verdict.
- **Routes**: Named exits that route the flow to the next Step or an End step.

## Flows

A **flow** defines how input data moves through a series of steps until a final outcome is produced.

## Start and end step

Every flow must contain exactly one **Start step** as its entry point and at least one **End step** representing a final outcome. Each session of a flow always ends in an End step, and therefore always results in a final outcome of either `accepted` or `rejected`.

Between the Start step and the End step, you can add any combination of **operative steps** (processing steps) to perform operations, transform data and control the routing of the flow.

## Steps

**Steps** are modular building blocks within a flow, each representing a single operational step. Typical examples include Identity verification (IDV), AML screening, Digital signals or Electronic Signature.

Between the Start step and the End step, other **operative steps** perform operations and transform data or control flow branching through **verdicts**.

Each step session results in exactly one **verdict**, which in turn determines:

- which **data blocks** are produced or updated, and  
- how the flow continues via **Routes** to either another Step or an End step.

---

## Verdicts

Each step can produce one or more **verdicts**, which describe the result of a step operation. For example, the verdicts of an Identity verification (IDV) step are:

- `verified`
- `fraud`
- `failure`

In the flow, the verdict is used to select the next route: it either routes to a follow-up step or to an End step, which sets the final outcome shown in the API (for example, accepted or rejected). See also the chapter **routes** for more explanation.

In the API response, each verdict includes structured data that explains the result.

## Data blocks

Each step consumes and produces typed **data blocks**. 

Examples of such data blocks could be `ExtendedIdentity`, `DocumentVerification` and `DocumentData`. 

Data blocks keep data consistent as it moves through the flow. The platform determines which data blocks are available at each step, verifies that all required inputs are present, and ensures data dependencies are satisfied before executing a step.

The data block structure is preserved in the API response after a flow session, making it easy to trace data from the initial input to the final outcome.

### As step output

The verdict of a step determines which data blocks it produces.

As an example, in an identity verification flow, a capture failure produces no `DocumentData` or `ExtendedIdentity`, while a capture failure or a fraud verdict always includes `DocumentVerification` results. 

Many data blocks also carry the step’s verdict to indicate the outcome of the check that generated them.

*An Identity verification step generates different data blocks depending on whether the verdict is verified, fraud, or failure.*

### As step input

Some steps, such as AML screening

- produces a `PepAndSanctionsResults` data block as output.
- but **require** a `BasicIdentity` data block as **input**.

Each step defines which data blocks it requires and which it produces for each verdict.

Data blocks flow from each step’s outputs to the inputs of the next steps. These definitions allow the system to validate the flow, ensuring all required inputs are available before a step executes. The data block can be included in the initial API request when a flow is executed as shown in the example below.

### Missing data blocks

If a required data block is missing, the step cannot execute. As an example, an AML screening step requires a `BasicIdentity` data block, which can be provided either 

- in the initial API request or 
- produced by an upstream step

All outputs from a step are added to the flow context, making them accessible to all of its descendant steps. As a result, any Step that generates a `BasicIdentity`, such as an Identity verification step, can satisfy the AML screening step’s input requirement.

### Duplications

In more complex flows, a step may require multiple instances of the same data block type as **input** (for example, two `BasicIdentity` data blocks for comparison). In such cases, the steps input array contains the same data block type multiple times, with each occurrence representing a separate instance.

When multiple upstream steps generate data blocks of the same type as **output**, the platform currently uses the last produced instance.

## Routes

**Routes** define how flows choose their next step. Routes are named exits on a step and determine which path the flow follows. Routes effectively turn step verdicts into transitions:

- If a step ends in the `verified` scenario, the transition with route `"verified"` is taken.
- If a transition has no route, it maps to the default scenario.

A simplified transition object looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "next_step_id",   // Identifier of the target Step
  "route": "verified"      // Named route for conditional transitions (e.g., "verified", "failure")
}
```

When a step is configured with multiple output scenarios, the scenario keys act as route names (for example, `verified`, `fraud_detected`, `capture_failed`, `default`).

## Putting it together

A flow is composed of steps, verdicts, data blocks, and routes. When designing a flow:

1. **Define the initial process steps**  
   For example, start with an ID verification step that outputs multiple verdicts (`success`, `fraud`, `capture_failed`) through corresponding routes, each connected to the appropriate next step or end step.

2. **Reuse outputs between steps**  
   Data blocks produced by one step can be used as inputs to downstream steps. For instance, a `BasicIdentity` data block created during ID verification can be passed to an _AML screening_ step, which then produces its own verdict and `PepAndSanctionsResults` data blocks.

3. **Extend the flow as needed**  
   Add additional steps for risk checks, digital signals, signatures, or evidence collection. Each step follows the same pattern of verdicts, data blocks, and routes.

*By combining steps, verdicts, data blocks, and routes, you can build complex trust flows.*

By understanding these building blocks, you can compose complex trust flows simply by wiring steps together. The platform handles session, data propagation, and audit trails automatically.
