# Integration

Ship identity flows in minutes, not weeks.

One authentication. Three endpoints. Unlimited workflows.

The API returns only what you need. No bloat. No unnecessary PII exposure. Request full data when you want it. Ignore it when you don't.

<Note>
Built for privacy-first teams who move fast.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authenticate once" icon="key">
    OAuth 2.0. Standard flow. Works everywhere.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execute any workflow" icon="play">
    `POST /v1/workflows/{id}/executions` — Start verification, login, signature, fraud check. Whatever you built.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get status instantly" icon="bolt">
    `GET /v1/executions/{id}` — Poll for completion. Datablock references only. Fast responses.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fetch data on demand" icon="download">
    `GET /v1/executions/{id}/datablocks` — Request identity data when you actually need it.
  </Step>
</Steps>
