title: Verification method selector
description: Presents users with a list of identity verification methods and routes the workflow based on user selection.
---

The purpose of this step is to enable the display of a page within a workflow that presents users with a list of client-specified identity verification methods. Based on the choice made by the user, they are then directed to the step associated with the chosen method.

## Key features

- **User-driven selection**: Displays a selection page in Player with available verification methods
- **Dynamic ports**: Creates output ports dynamically based on configured methods
- **Method assets**: Each method includes display assets (label, image, country)
- **Flexible routing**: No constraints on the type of step that can be associated with transitions


## Configuration

| Attribute | Type  | Required | Description |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| `methods` | Array | Yes | A list of unique string identifiers for the verification methods to be offered (e.g., doc_id, france_identite, eudi_wallet). Each string is used to name a corresponding dynamic output port. Minimum 1 method required. |

**Frontend implications:**

Each method that can be defined as an option is associated with a set of assets intended for displaying a selection block, which contains the radio button for the selection:

- A label associated with the method (its title)
- An image displayed within the block
- The country to which this method is associated (e.g., "France" for France Identité or "Germany" for AusweisID)

## Example

```json
{
  "methods": [
    "doc_id",
    "france_identite",
    "eudi_wallet_verifier"
  ]
}
```
