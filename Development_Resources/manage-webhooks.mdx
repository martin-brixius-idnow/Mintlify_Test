IDnow sends HTTP webhooks for each session. Webhooks allow you to keep your system in sync and let you know when new results or data blocks are ready.

Note that session steps are ***asynchronous***.

:::info
See the full list of available webhook events here: [Webhook events →](/integration/webhooks-events)
:::

:::info
**Key characteristics:** - Thin payloads only (never contains PII) - All events sent by default - Asynchronous delivery (order not guaranteed) - Automatic retries for transient failures
:::

## Checklist

Before receiving webhooks, complete these steps:

<details>
<summary>1. Expose a secure HTTPS endpoint</summary>

Your endpoint must support **TLS 1.2 or higher** for receiving POST requests.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Only allow incoming requests from IDnow’s IPs</summary>

Block unauthorized sources by accepting requests only from documented IDnow IPs.

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Enable JWT signature verification (recommended)</summary>

Use our signed JTW to verify webhook authenticity and prevent spoofing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Respond with HTTP 2xx within 10 seconds</summary>

Return a success status quickly and process events asynchronously in the background.

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Use `event_id` to prevent duplicate operations</summary>

Track `event_id` to detect and skip duplicate deliveries caused by retries.

</details>

## Setting up webhooks

Webhook endpoints are fully manageable after creation. You can update an existing endpoint at any time like adjusting its URL, description, or security settings or delete it completely if it's no longer required.

### 1. Expose an endpoint

Your endpoint must support HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ and return HTTP 2xx within 10 seconds.

:::tip
Return 2xx **immediately**, then process events asynchronously to avoid timeouts.
:::

| Requirement       | Details                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Protocol**      | HTTPS with TLS 1.2+                      |
| **Response time** | Return 2xx within 10 seconds             |
| **Capacity**      | Handle expected event volume             |
| **Idempotency**   | Process duplicates safely using event_id |

### 2. Configure webhooks on IDnow

Configure your webhooks on a flow-by-flow basis IDnow:

1. **Go to flow Settings**: In the IDnow dashboard, go to your flow, and navigate to the **Settings** tab. Then scroll down to **Webhooks**.
2. **Create endpoint**: Click "Add webhook" to open the configuration form.
3. **Add endpoint details**: Enter your HTTPS endpoint URL and other details.
4. **Subscribe to events**: Select specific events or receive all events by default.
5. **Set secret key**: Provide a secret key for authentication in the headers section.

:::info
Configure separate endpoints for **staging**, and **live** environments. You can update an existing endpoint, including its URL, after creation.

### 3. Handle webhooks

#### Verify the source

<details>
<summary>Validate IP address</summary>

Accept requests only from IDnow's documented IP ranges.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Verify JWT signature</summary>

Optionally, use your secret key to validate the JWT in the request header. See the Security page for details.

</details>

#### Process the event

1. **Return 2xx immediately**: Respond within 10 seconds to acknowledge receipt.
2. **Check for duplicates**: Use event_id to detect already-processed events.
3. **Queue for processing**: Add the event to a background queue.

#### Prevent failures

Your endpoint must respond within **10 seconds**. Responses taking longer are treated as failures and trigger retries.

:::tip
Process webhook events asynchronously. Acknowledge receipt immediately (return HTTP 2xx) and queue the event for background processing.
:::

#### Retry logic

IDnow automatically retries failed deliveries:

| Attempt   | Delay     | Total elapsed time |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| 1st retry | 2 seconds | 2s                 |
| 2nd retry | 4 seconds | 6s                 |
| 3rd retry | 8 seconds | 14s                |

**Retry conditions:**

- Transient errors (5xx status codes)
- Network errors (timeout, connection refused)
- Endpoint unavailable

**No retry for:**

- Client errors (4xx status codes)
- Authentication failures
- Invalid endpoint URL

After maximum retries, the event is moved to the **dead letter queue**.
