# Platform Guides

Build production identity flows with copy-paste recipes.vAll orchestrated through typed workflows and auditable paths.

These guides give you ready-to-run workflow patterns for common identity problems. Each recipe is a minimal, adaptable skeleton you can deploy today.

---

## What you get

Unified orchestration across document checks, data verification, wallet-based login, qualified electronic signatures, device trust signals, and AML/PEP screening.

Every workflow uses typed datablocks and explicit transitions. You control data minimization, audit granularity, and provider selection. No vendor lock-in. Full compliance traceability.

## How recipes work

Each recipe follows the same structure:

**Purpose**: One-line summary of what it solves.

**When to use**: Clear trigger conditions.

**Required nodes**: Workflow steps and their versions.

**Datablocks**: Input and output types.

**Workflow skeleton**: Minimal JSON you can copy and adapt.

**Checklist**: Integration steps from setup to production.

All workflows validate at design time. All transitions require explicit port mapping. All datablocks are typed and traceable.
