title: DOC_ID_HEADLESS:v1
---

## Overview

The DOC_ID_HEADLESS:v1 node performs headless document verification that processes pre-captured document and biometric data. It validates document authenticity and extracts identity information from documents without user interaction during the step execution.

---

## Characteristics

- **Headless Processing**: Processes pre-captured data without user interaction during step execution
- **Consent Required**: Requires BiometricSamples with `consent = true`
- **Document Validation**: Validates document authenticity
- **Identity Extraction**: Extracts identity information from documents
- **Multiple Output Scenarios**: Supports conditional output based on verification results

## Configuration Options

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| biometricProcessing | object | No | A container for parameters related to biometric verification. If this object is not provided, no biometric analysis is performed. The configuration of the IDCheck.io realm must be aligned with the options set in this step. |
| biometricProcessing.sampleType | enum | No | Defines the type of biometric sample provided. Currently, only the value `'SELFIE'` is supported. |

## Types of Input Data

| DataBlock Type | Required | Description |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| `DocumentImages` | Yes | Pre-captured document images (front and/or back side) |
| `BiometricSamples` | Yes | Pre-captured biometric data with `consent = true` |

**Important:** The BiometricSamples DataBlock must have the `consent` field set to `true`. This serves as explicit confirmation that the client has lawfully obtained the user's consent before submitting the data for processing.

## Types of Output Data

The DOC_ID_HEADLESS:v1 node produces different outputs depending on the outcome of the verification process.

| Scenario | DataBlocks Produced | Description |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| verified | `BasicIdentity`, `ExtendedIdentity`, `DocumentData`, `DocumentImages`, `DocumentVerification`, `BiometricSamples` | Successful document processing with identity extraction |
| fraud_detected | `DocumentVerification` | Document identified as fraudulent |
| capture_failed | `DocumentVerification` | Document capture failed |
| default | `DocumentVerification` | Unexpected or technical error during processing |
