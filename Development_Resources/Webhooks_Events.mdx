## Overview

Idnow sends webhook events for different stages of a flow execution. Each event provides information about the current state of the configured flow journey.


<Info>
All events use thin payloads. No personally identifiable information (PII) are included by default.
</Info>

## Event Payload Structure

All webhook events share a common structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `event_id` | String | Same ID across retries for the same event |
| `event_name` | String | Format: `resource.action` |
| `delivery_id` | String | Unique per retry attempt (sequence: 1, 2, 3) |
| `createdAt` | ISO 8601 | When the webhook was sent |
| `flowId` | String | The identifier of the flow that was triggered |
| `execution_id` | UUID | The identifier of the specific execution (session) |
| `execution_status` | Enum | Current status of the flow |
| `decision_outcome` | String | Final decision result, provided only when the flow has completed |
| `last_node_id` | String | Identifier of the last executed node, ID is defined by you in the node configuration |
| `last_node_type` | String | Name of the last executed node |
| `last_node_status` | String | Status of the last executed node (e.g., Aborted) |

<Info>
The `event_id` remains the same across all retry attempts, while `delivery_id` increments.
</Info>

## Flow Execution Events

Idnow sends the following event types when a flow execution changes state:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| flow_execution.created | Flow is initialized and ready to start |
| flow_execution.started | User has begun the verification journey |
| flow_execution.completed | Flow ends with final outcome |
| flow_execution.expired | Flow expiry TTL reached, no longer usable |
| flow_execution.aborted | Flow ends by user interaction with no final outcome |
| flow_execution.error | Flow enters ERROR state and stops processing |

## Event Payloads Examples

All webhook payloads are a minimal, machine-readable JSON message that delivers metadata about an event and will never include any PII. You can fetch full details from the API when needed by using the respective `flow execution_id`.
