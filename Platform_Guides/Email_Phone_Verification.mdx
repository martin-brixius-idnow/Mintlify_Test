title: Email and phone verification 
description: Assesses trust signals from a user’s contact details.
---

Helps businesses identify suspicious or trustworthy behaviour based on email, phone, name, and IP data before the user continues with e.g. identity verification or electronic signiture processes. 

---

## Key features

- Computes a ***trust score*** from email, phone, IP and name signals.
- Routes flow using ***configurable thresholds***: suspiciousUserThreshold and trustedUserThreshold.
- ***Optional `inputSources`*** to specify step IDs (basicIdentity, extendedIdentity, deviceSignals); otherwise uses latest data blocks.
- ***Produces `DigitalSignals`*** for trusted, suspicious, and not_trusted; inconclusive when no definitive assessment.

## Configuration

| Parameter                       | Type    | Required | Default | Description |
|---------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `suspiciousUserThreshold`       | Integer | Yes      |         | The score threshold (in percent) below which a user is considered "suspicious". |
| `trustedUserThreshold`          | Integer | Yes      |         | The score threshold (in percent) above which a user is considered "trusted". |
| `inputSources`                  | Object  | No       |         | Specifies the flow step IDs to use for sourcing data. If omitted, the step will use the latest available data blocks from the flow. |
| `inputSources.basicIdentity`    | String  | No       |         | The step ID providing basic identity data (e.g. first name, last name). |
| `inputSources.extendedIdentity` | String  | No       |         | The step ID providing extended identity data (e.g. phone, email). |
| `inputSources.deviceSignals`    | String  | No       |         | The step ID providing device signal data (e.g. IP address). |

## Input data blocks

If the input sources are not specified, this step attempts to retrieve the information directly from the execution context. In other words, it will fetch the latest available data blocks (`BasicIdentity`, `ExtendedIdentity`, and `DeviceSignals`) if they exist.

## Verdicts

Verdicts for this data block.

| Verdict        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `trusted`      | The score computed is greater than or equal to `trustedUserThreshold`. |
| `suspicious`   | The score computed is less than or equal to `suspiciousUserThreshold`. |
| `not_trusted`  | The score computed is between `suspiciousUserThreshold` and `trustedUserThreshold`. |
| `inconclusive` | The provider cannot compute a definitive score or assessment. |
