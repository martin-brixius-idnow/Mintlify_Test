## How it works

Ship identity flows in minutes, not weeks. One authentication. A small, stable set of endpoints. Unlimited identity journeys.

<Note>
The API returns only what you need. No bloat. No unnecessary PII exposure. Request full data when you want it. Ignore it when you don’t.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authenticate once" icon="key">
    Obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token using the Get Token endpoint and reuse it across all flows.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive available flows" icon="list-tree">
    Use `GET /flows` to list all flows configured in your environment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a verification session" icon="play">
    Start a new session with `POST /flows/FLOW_ID/sessions` and receive a sessionId and sessionToken.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track status and decisions" icon="bolt">
    Poll `GET /session/SESSION_ID` to retrieve status, decision outcome, timestamps, and the last executed step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fetch data and files on demand" icon="download">
    Retrieve identity data via `GET /session/SESSION_ID/datablocks` and files via `GET /files/FILE_ID` only when needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why developers choose this API

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Privacy by default" icon="lock" color="#10b981">
    Session and flow endpoints return lean decision metadata and Datablock references instead of raw PII. You control when sensitive data is accessed.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Clear session model" icon="arrows-maximize" color="#3b82f6">
    Flows define business logic. Sessions represent individual user journeys. This separation keeps integrations predictable and easy to reason about.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Audit-ready by design" icon="route" color="#8b5cf6">
    Sessions record status, timestamps, subject references, and the last executed step, enabling full decision traceability.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Flexible frontends" icon="display" color="#f59e0b">
    Use the same backend APIs for redirects or embedded Player experiences without changing your integration.

<Tip>
  Pro tip: In development, inspect full payloads. In production, rely on lean session results and fetch Datablocks and files only when required.
