description: Flows, Steps, Verdicts and DataBlocks.

This page explains the core building blocks of the IDnow Trust Platform and how they work together to form end-to-end flows:

- **Flow**: A flow that runs from start to end and defines the operational steps leading to a final outcome.
- **Start & End Step**: The flow ends in an End Step that determines whether the outcome is accepted or rejected.
- **Steps**: A Step performs an operational step that reads inputs, writes DataBlocks, and produces a verdict.
- **Verdicts**: A verdict defines the Step’s result and determines the output DataBlocks and the next routing step (e.g., "verified", "fraud").
- **DataBlocks**: Typed payloads that act as inputs or outputs of a Step depending on its verdict.
- **Routes**: Named exits that route the flow to the next Step or an End Step.

## Flows

At IDnow, a **flow** defines how input data moves through a series of steps until a final outcome is produced.

### Start and and End Step

Every flow must contain exactly one **Start Step** as its entry point and at least one **End Step** representing a final outcome. Each session of a flow always ends in an End Step, and therefore always results in a final outcome of either `accepted` or `rejected`.

Between Start and End, you can add any combination of **operative Steps** (processing steps) to perform operations, transform data and control the routing of the flow.

## Steps

**Steps** are modular building blocks within a Trust Platform flow, each representing a single operational step. Typical examples include Identity Verification (IDV), AML Screening, Digital Signals or Electronic Signature.

Between the Start and End Steps, other **operative Steps** perform operations and transform data or control flow branching through **verdicts**.

Each Step session results in exactly one **verdict**, which in turn determines:

- which **DataBlocks** are produced or updated, and  
- how the flow continues via **Routes** to either another Step or an End Step.

---

## Verdicts

Each Step can produce one or more **verdicts**, which describe the ***result*** of a Step operation. As an example, for an Identity Verification (IDV) Step, defined verdicts are

- `verified`
- `fraud`
- `failure`

In the flow, the verdict is used to select the next route: it either routes to a follow-up Step or to an End Step, which sets the final outcome shown in the API (for example, accepted or rejected). See also the chapter **Routes** for more explanation.

In the API response, each verdict includes structured data that explains the result.

## DataBlocks

Each Step consumes and produces typed **DataBlocks**. 

Examples of such DataBlocks could be `ExtendedIdentity`, `DocumentVerification` and `DocumentData`. 

DataBlocks keep data consistent as it moves through the flow. The platform determines which DataBlocks are available at each step, verifies that all required inputs are present, and ensures data dependencies are satisfied before executing a Step.

The DataBlock structure is preserved in the API response after a flow session, making it easy to trace data from the initial input to the final outcome.

### As Step Output

A Step’s **verdict** determines which DataBlocks it produces. 

As an example, in an IDV flow, a capture failure produces no `DocumentData` or `ExtendedIdentity`, while a capture failure or a fraud verdict always includes `DocumentVerification` results. 

Many DataBlocks also carry the Step’s verdict to indicate the outcome of the check that generated them.

*An IDV Step generates different DataBlocks depending on whether the verdict is verified, fraud, or failure.*

### As Step Input

Some Steps, such as AML Screening

- produces a `PepAndSanctionsResults` DataBlock as output.
- but **require** a `BasicIdentity` DataBlock as **input**.

Each Step defines which DataBlocks it requires and which it produces for each verdict. 

DataBlocks flow from each Step’s outputs to the inputs of the next Steps. These definitions allow the system to validate the flow, ensuring all required inputs are available before a Step executes.The DataBlock can be included in the initial API request when a flow is executed as shown in the example below.

![Flow where an IDV Step creates a BasicIdentity DataBlock that is used as input for AML Screening, which in turn produces a PepAndSanctionsResults DataBlock.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-brixius-idnow/Mintlify_Test/main/images/trustplatform-aml-screening-match-no-match-alt.png)

### Missing DataBlocks

If a required DataBlock is missing, the Step cannot execute. As an example, the AML Screening Step requires a BasicIdentity DataBlock, which can be provided either 

- in the initial API request or 
- produced by an upstream Step

All outputs from a Step are added to the flow context, making them accessible to all of its descendant Steps. As a result, any Step that generates a BasicIdentity, such as an IDV Step, can satisfy the AML Screening Step’s input requirement.

### Duplications

In more complex flows, a Step may require multiple instances of the same DataBlock type as **input** (for example, two `BasicIdentity` DataBlocks for comparison). In such cases, the Steps input array contains the same DataBlock type multiple times, with each occurrence representing a separate instance.

When multiple upstream Steps generate DataBlocks of the same type as **output**, the platform currently uses the last produced instance.

## Routes

**Routes** define how flows choose their next step. Routes are named exits on a Step and determine which path the flow follows. Routes effectively turn Step verdicts into transitions:

- If a step ends in the `verified` scenario, the transition with route `"verified"` is taken.
- If a transition has no route, it maps to the default scenario.

A simplified transition object looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "next_Step_id",   // Identifier of the target Step
  "route": "verified"      // Named route for conditional transitions (e.g., "verified", "failure")
}
```

When a Step is configured in Studio with multiple output scenarios, the scenario keys act as route names (for example, `verified`, `fraud_detected`, `capture_failed`, `default`).

## Putting It Together

A Trust Platform flow is composed of Steps, verdicts, DataBlocks, and Routes. When designing a flow:

1. **Define the initial process steps**  
   For example, start with an ID verification Step that outputs multiple verdicts (`success`, `fraud`, `capture_failed`) through corresponding Routes, each connected to the appropriate next Step or End Step.

2. **Reuse outputs between Steps**  
   DataBlocks produced by one Step can be used as inputs to downstream Steps. For instance, a `BasicIdentity` DataBlock created during ID verification can be passed to an AML Screening Step, which then produces its own verdict and `PepAndSanctionsResults` DataBlocks.

3. **Extend the flow as needed**  
   Add additional Steps for risk checks, digital signals, signatures, or evidence collection. Each Step follows the same pattern of verdicts, DataBlocks, and Routes.

*By combining Steps, verdicts, DataBlocks, and Routes, you can build complex trust flows  in the Trust Platform.*

By understanding these building blocks, you can compose complex trust flows simply by wiring Steps together. The platform handles session, data propagation, and audit trails automatically.
