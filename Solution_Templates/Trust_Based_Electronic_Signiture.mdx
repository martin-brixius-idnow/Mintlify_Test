title: "Trust-Based electronic signature"
description: "Enable document signing with pre-verified identities and device trust assessment"
---

Enables document signing for users who already have ***verified AML identity data***, while intelligently adapting the flow based on device trust signals to balance ***security and user experience***.

![Trust-Based Electronic Signiture.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-brixius-idnow/Mintlify_Test/main/images/Templates_Trust_Based_Electronic_Signiture.png)

In this recommended flow, the customer’s system uses ***existing AML-compliant identity data*** from a previous verification to issue a signature without requiring users to repeat full identity proofing. Before the signature is created, the platform performs a ***device trust assessment***, evaluating behavioral and technical signals to determine whether the device and network environment appear safe.

If the environment ***is trusted***, the process continues seamlessly using the stored identity data. If the environment is ***suspicious or untrusted***, the flow introduces a ***light dynamic verification step***, prompting the user to provide a fresh set of identity evidence. This adaptive approach applies “healthy friction” only when risk is detected, ensuring compliance and fraud prevention while maintaining a smooth experience for low-risk users.

This trust-based signature flow helps organizations ***optimize security, compliance, and user experience***, protecting against identity misuse and device-based fraud while keeping high completion rates.

Key benefits

- ***Adaptive trust decisioning*** – Dynamically routes sessions based on device and network risk signals.
- ***Frictionless experience for trusted users*** – Enables immediate signing using existing AML identity data.
- ***Healthy friction for suspicious sessions*** – Requests renewed verification only when anomalies are detected.
- ***Optimized risk and UX balance*** – Strengthens fraud prevention without compromising conversion.
- ***Compliance-ready*** – Maintains alignment with AML and eIDAS requirements for secure electronic signatures.

## Flow logic

***Step overview***

| Step | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| 1. `Start` | Entry point; collects input data blocks |
| 2. `Device Intelligence` | Analyzes device trustworthiness |
| 3a. `Electronic Signature` | Enables document signing (trusted path) |
| 3b. ` Document-based IDV (Capture)` | Verifies identity via. Document-based IDV (untrusted path) |
| 4. `End` | Final decision: accepted or rejected |

***Verdict routing***

This flow uses a risk-based routing mechanism where verdicts at each step determine the next action. Trusted devices proceed directly to signing, while untrusted or suspicious devices require additional identity verification.

| Step | Verdict | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Device Intelligence | `trusted` | Device recognized, normal behavior | Proceed to Electronic Signature |
| Device Intelligence | `suspicious`, `not_trusted`, `inconclusive`, `else` | Unknown device or anomalies detected | Route to Document-based IDV (Capture) |
| Electronic Signature | `success` | Signing completed successfully | Session outcome `accepted` |
| Electronic Signature | `identity_expired` | Pre-verified identity exceeded validity period | Session outcome `rejected` |
| Document-based IDV (Capture) | `verified` | Identity confirmed via Document-based IDV | Route to Electronic Signature  |
| Document-based IDV (Capture) | `fraud_detected`, `aborted`, `cancelled`, `else` | Fraud, user abandonment, or errors | Session outcome `rejected` |

## Configuration

***Device signals***

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `suspiciousUserThreshold` | Integer (≥0) | Threshold for "suspicious" classification based on suspectScore |
| `notTrustedUserThreshold` | Integer (≥0) | Threshold for "not_trusted" classification based on suspectScore |
| `confidenceScoreThreshold` | Float (0-100) | Minimum fingerprint confidence; below this value result is "inconclusive" |

**Example:**

```json
{
  "suspiciousUserThreshold": 50,
  "notTrustedUserThreshold": 75,
  "confidenceScoreThreshold": 60
}
```



***Electronic signature***

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `signingConfiguration.signatureLevel` | enum | QES or AES (required) |

***Signature levels:***

| Level | Legal Effect | Required Input Data Blocks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **QES** | Equivalent to handwritten signature (eIDAS). Requires strict identity verification. | `ExtendedIdentity`, `DocumentData`, `DocumentsToSign` |
| **AES** | Uniquely linked to signer. No regulated identity-proofing required. | `ExtendedIdentity`, `DocumentsToSign` |

**Note**: The value associated with the signature level must be aligned with the configuration defined on InstantSign.

***Example:***

```json
{
  "signingConfiguration": {
    "signatureLevel": "QES"
  }
}
```

---

## Input data blocks

Provide these data blocks when creating a session:

| Data block type | Description | Required For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BasicIdentity` | Pre-verified identity data | All flows |
| `DocumentData` | Identity document information | QES signature level |
| `DocumentsToSign` | Documents requiring signature | All flows |

**Note:** `DeviceSignals` are auto-collected by Trust Platform.

---

## Output data blocks

***Trusted device path***

When device signals indicate high trust and signature succeeds:

| Data block type | Created By | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DeviceSignals` | device_signals | Device trust assessment results |
| `SignedDocumentsPackage` | electronic_signature | Signed documents and metadata |

***Untrusted device path***

When device signals trigger identity re-verification:

| Data block type | Created By Step | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DeviceSignals` | Device Signals | Device trust assessment results |
| `DocumentImages` |  Document-based IDV (Capture) | Uploaded document images |
| `DocumentData` |  Document-based IDV (Capture) | Extracted document data |
| `ExtendedIdentity` | Document-based IDV (Capture) | Verified identity data |
| `BiometricSamples` |  Document-based IDV (Capture) | Liveness/selfie capture |
| `DocumentVerification` | Document verification step | Verification results |
| `SignedDocumentsPackage` | Electronic Signature | Signed documents and metadata |

*The listed output datablocks represent the data returned after the identity has been successfully verified and the documents have been signed. Other verdicts will produce a different combination of output data blocks.
