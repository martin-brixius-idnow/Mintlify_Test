title: Instant Signature Issuance
description: Electronic signing with legally recognized assurance levels.
---

Enables real‑time electronic signature issuance using verified identity data already available at the time of signing.

This step is designed for flows where AML‑compliant identity data has already been verified and can be provided to IDnow instantly — either by the customer’s system or through a reusable identity scheme. It uses that data, along with the document metadata and the document itself, to issue a signature immediately without initiating a new identity verification.

Instant Signature Issuance supports both Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) and Advanced Electronic Signatures (AES) in accordance with eIDAS and AML requirements. Because all required inputs are accessible in real time, this step executes instantly and provides an optimal balance between compliance and user experience — ideal for trusted, high‑speed processes such as digital agreements, account management, or in‑platform signing flows.

### Key features

***Real‑time execution*** – Issues signatures instantly using available verified identity data.
***Supports QES and AES*** – Fully compliant with eIDAS signature levels.
***Reusable identity integration*** – Leverages AML‑verified identities or reusable identity schemes.
***Low friction*** – No need for the user to repeat verification during signing.

*Ideal for trusted environments – Optimized for users and transactions with pre‑established trust.

## Configuration

| Parameter              | Type          | Required | Default | Description |
|------------------------|---------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `signingConfiguration` | Object        | Yes      | -       | A container for parameters that define the signature process. |
| `signatureLevel`       | String (enum) | Yes      | -       | The `signatureLevel` selected in the flow must be enabled and correctly configured for the customer's account within the underlying signature provider (e.g. `InstantSign`). A mismatch between the flow definition and the provider's configuration may lead to a runtime error. |

**QES (Qualified Electronic Signature):** The highest level of assurance. Under eIDAS, a QES has the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature. It requires strict, verified identification of the signer before the signature is created.

**AES (Advanced Electronic Signature):** A secure digital signature that is uniquely linked to the signer. Unlike QES, it does not require the strict, regulated identity-proofing process (such as a face-to-face or equivalent ID document check) mandated before signing. It is therefore widely used for many types of agreements and contracts.

## Input data blocks

Input requirements for this step.

| Data block        | Mandatory                         | Description |
|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| `BasicIdentity`  | Yes                                | Always required. It provides the signer's fundamental identity information (e.g. name, date of birth), which is essential for any signature level. |
| `DocumentData`   | Yes if `signatureLevel` is `QES`   | Required only if `signatureLevel` is QES. It provides the information of the identity document of the signer expected for a QES signature. Its `expiryDate` attribute is used to pre-validate the signer's identity document, which is a mandatory check for a QES process. |
| `DocumentsToSign`| Yes                                | Always required. It contains the references to the documents uploaded by the customers that the end-user must sign. The signature should be applied according to the template referenced in the data block and defined in the InstantSign configuration. |

## Verdicts

Verdicts for this data block.

| Verdict            | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `success`          | The signature process completed successfully. All mandatory documents have been signed, and any optional documents have been either signed or skipped by the user. The produced SignedDocumentsPackage contains the identifier transaction and a reference to the archive containing all the signed documents and (regulatory proofs). |
| `identity_expired` | The process was aborted before initiating the signature process. A pre-check determined that the signer's identity document has expired, based on the `expiryDate` from the input `DocumentData`. |
| `failure`          | The signature process was initiated but did not complete successfully due to a handled error or a specific user action. This includes scenarios like the user explicitly canceling the process on the InstantSign's UI, or InstantSign returning a specific business rejection (e.g. user not eligible). |
