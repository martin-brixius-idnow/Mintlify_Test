title: Device Intelligence
description: Evaluates the trustworthiness of the customer’s device.
---

## Overview

Helps determine whether the device appears safe, familiar, and genuine or if there are signs of unusual activity, automation, or manipulation.

---

## Key Features

- Integrates ***device signals services*** (e.g., Fingerprint) to assess device risk and detect fraud attempts.
- ***Analyses automation***, environment manipulation, VMs/emulators, and behavioral anomalies.
- ***Configurable risk thresholds*** via `suspiciousUserThreshold`, `notTrustedUserThreshold`, and `confidenceScoreThreshold`.
- ***Output mapping*** based on `suspectScore` and `confidence.score` thresholds.

## Configuration

| Parameter                   | Type   | Required | Default | Description |
|----------------------------|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `suspiciousUserThreshold`  | Integer| -        | -       | Defines the threshold at which a user is considered â€œsuspiciousâ€ based on suspectScore. |
| `notTrustedUserThreshold`  | Integer| -        | -       | Defines the threshold at which a user is considered â€œnot_trustedâ€ based on suspectScore. |
| `confidenceScoreThreshold` | Float  | -        | -       | Sets the minimum fingerprint confidence.score below which the result is deemed â€œinconclusiveâ€ and routed to

## Verdicts

Verdicts for this DataBlock.


| Verdict        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `trusted`      | The device is considered trustworthy as the suspect score is below the defined suspicious threshold. |
| `suspicious`   | The device is flagged as suspicious because the suspect score has exceeded the suspicious threshold. |
| `not_trusted`  | The device is deemed not trusted as the suspect score has surpassed the high-risk (not trusted) threshold. |
| `inconclusive` | A verdict could not be reached because the confidence score was below the required threshold. |

## Output DataBlock

DataBlocks produced per verdict.

| Verdict         | DataBlocks Produced | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **trusted**     | `DeviceSignals`     |       |
| **suspicious**  | `DeviceSignals`     |       |
| **not_trusted** | `DeviceSignals`     |       |
| **inconclusive**| `DeviceSignals`     |       |

## Output Mapping

| Result                                         | Mapped Output |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `confidence.score < confidenceScoreThreshold`  | `inconclusive`|
| `suspectScore < suspiciousUserThreshold`       | `trusted`     |
| `suspectScore > suspiciousUserThreshold`       | `suspicious`  |
| `suspectScore > notTrustedUserThreshold`       | `not_trusted` |
