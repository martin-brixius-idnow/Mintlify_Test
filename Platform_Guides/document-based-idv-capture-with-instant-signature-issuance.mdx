#### Unified document-based IDV with Instant signature issuance

Combines document-based IDV in Capture mode with instant signature issuance capabilities.This unified approach streamlines customer onboarding and contract execution while maintaining compliance with document-based IDV and electronic signature regulations.

Users can complete document-based IDV through agent-assisted review (VideoIdent), automated visual verification (AutoIdent), combined with either contract signing (eSign) or qualified electronic signature (QES). Each mode ensures compliance with regulations such as eIDAS, AML, GwG, and BaFin.

## Key features

This step can operate in one of three three modes, driven entirely by the configured shortname:

- Instant signature issuance with Capture step: This flow is used when the primary goal is to get a document signed. The user first reviews the document, then completes a Capture step to confirm their identity. After this verification, the user signs the document. The trust requirement is to ensure that the person signing the document is the authorized individual.

- Document-based IDV with qualified electronic signature (QES): This flow is used when the primary goal is identity verification, not contract signing. No contract is provided. The process focuses on performing an AML‑compliant document-based IDV step, and the trust seal/signature element is added only as an additional verification layer, not as a contract signature.

## Input data blocks

Input requirements for this step.

| Data block        | Mandatory   | Description                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BasicIdentity`   | Yes         | BasicIdentity data containing first name and last name to initiate the verification session                 |

| `verified`       | Successful document processing with identity extraction and signing. User's documents were successfully verified and signed.          |
| `fraud_detected` | Document or liveness identified as fraudulent. This occurs when fraud is confirmed after manual review. No signed documents produced. |
| `cancelled`      | The verification process was cancelled by the agent, for instance due to blurry images or unusable documents.                         |
