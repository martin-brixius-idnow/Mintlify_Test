## Overview

Idnow sends webhook events for different stages of a session. Each event provides information about the current state of the configured flow journey.

<Info>
All events use thin payloads. No personally identifiable information (PII) is included by default.  
To learn how to configure Webhooks, see the guide here:

## Event Payload Structure

All webhook events share a common structure:

| Field            | Type      | Description                                                                                      |
|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `eventId`        | String    | Same ID across retries for the same event                                                        |
| `eventVersion`   | String    | Current event version                                                                     |
| `eventName`      | String    | Format: `resource.action`                                                                        |
| `eventDeliverId` | String    | Unique per retry attempt (sequence: 1, 2, 3)                                                     |
| `createdAt`      | ISO 8601  | When the webhook was sent                                                                        |
| `flowId`         | String    | The identifier of the flow that was triggered                                                    |
| `sessionId`      | UUID      | The identifier of the specific session                                                           |
| `sessionStatus`| Enum      | Current status of the flow                                                                       |
| `lastStepId`     | String    | Identifier of the last executed step, ID is defined by you in the step configuration             |
| `lastStepType`   | String    | Name of the last executed step                                                                   |
| `lastStepStatus` | String    | Status of the last executed step (e.g., Aborted)                                                 |

<Info>
The `eventId` remains the same across all retry attempts, while `delivery_id` increments.

## Session Events

Idnow sends the following event types when a session changes state:

| Event Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| session.created | Flow is initialized and ready to start |
| session.started | User has begun the verification journey |
| session.completed | Flow ends with final outcome |
| session.expired | Flow expiry TTL reached, no longer usable |
| session.aborted | Flow ends by user interaction with no final outcome |
| session.error | Flow enters ERROR state and stops processing |

## Event Payloads Examples

All webhook payloads are a minimal, machine-readable JSON message that delivers metadata about an event and will never include any PII. You can fetch full details from the API when needed by using the respective `session_id`.
