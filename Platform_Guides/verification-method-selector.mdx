#### Allow users to choose their preferred identity verification method

Display a list of identity verification methods to the user. The user will be directed to the verification method of their choice.

---

## Key features

- **User-driven selection**: Shows the user a selection page with the available verification methods.
- **Dynamic ports**: Creates output ports dynamically based on configured methods.
- **Method assets**: Each method includes display assets (label, image, country).
- **Flexible routing**: No constraints on the type of step that can be associated with transitions.

## Configuration

| Attribute | Type  | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ----- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| methods   | array | Yes      | A list of unique string identifiers for the verification methods to be offered (e.g., doc_id, france_identite, eudi_wallet). Each string is used to name a corresponding dynamic output port. Minimum 1 method required. |

**Frontend implications:**

Each method that can be defined as an option is associated with a set of assets intended for displaying a selection block, which contains the radio button for the selection:

- A label associated with the method (its title)
- An image displayed within the block
- The country to which this method is associated (e.g. "France" for France Identité or "Germany" for AusweisID)

## Example

```json
{
  "methods": ["doc_id", "france_identite", "eudi_wallet_verifier"]
}
```
