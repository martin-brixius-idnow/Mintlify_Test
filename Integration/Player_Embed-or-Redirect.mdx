## Overview
## Prerequisites

Before integrating with the Player, you need to set up your flow:

- [x] **A Flow was created** in Studio.
- [x] **The Flow was deployed** and published.
- [x] **The flowId was obtained** from Studio or via the API.

### Integration Method

| Integration Method | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Redirect Integration** | Redirect users to the IDnow-hosted Player URL for a full-screen verification experience with guaranteed camera/microphone access (if permission is given by user). |
| **Embedded Integration** | Embed the Player within your web application using an iframe or webview to keep users on your domain while maintaining your UI context. |

### Integration Steps

1. Create a session via the Flow API, providing input Datablocks and a redirect URL (if redirect)
2. Obtain the Session Token (JWT) containing session context
3. Construct Player URL 
4. Choose your integration method (redirect or embedded)
