description: Implement security best practices to protect your webhook endpoints.
---

Secure your webhook endpoints to ensure that incoming requests genuinely originate from IDnow and have not been tampered with.

## Authentication

IDnow signs all webhook events with a JWT signature. You can verify this signature to ensure the webhook came from IDnow.

---

### API token

You must provide an API token when configuring your webhook endpoint in the IDnow dashboard. IDnow includes this token in the request header.

**Steps:**

1. **Add your API token**: Configure your API token in the IDnow dashboard when setting up the webhook endpoint.
2. **Verify the token**: Check the token in the request header matches your expected value.

---

### JWT signature

All webhook payloads are signed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). You can optionally verify the signature to confirm authenticity.

The JWT signature is included in the `X-Idnow-Signature` header with every webhook request.

:::info
JWT signature verification is optional but recommended for production environments.
:::

---

## IP whitelisting

Restrict your webhook endpoint to only accept requests from IDnow IP addresses.

:::info
IDnow maintains a limited and stable list of IP addresses for webhook delivery.
:::

### IP ranges

Add these IP ranges to your firewall or application allow list:

```text
203.0.113.0/24
198.51.100.0/24
192.0.2.0/24
```

:::note
Contact your account manager for the current production IP ranges.

## TLS requirements

Your webhook endpoint must support TLS 1.2 or higher. IDnow validates your endpoint's TLS configuration during setup.

**Supported TLS versions:**

- **TLS 1.2**: Supported and recommended
- **TLS 1.3**: Supported and recommended

---

## Security headers

IDnow includes these headers with every webhook request:

| Header              | Description                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Authorization`     | Your API token                       |
| `X-Idnow-Signature` | JWT signature of the payload         |
| `Content-Type`      | Always `application/json`            |
| `User-Agent`        | IDnow webhook service identifier     |
