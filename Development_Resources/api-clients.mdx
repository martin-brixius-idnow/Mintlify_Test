An API client securely authenticates your application with IDnow. You can manage multiple keys and their permissions in the IDnow dashboard.

Each API client has a **Client ID** and a **Client secret**. Never share client secrets or store them in version control.**

1. Log in to the IDnow dashboard at [hub.hub.dev.eu.idnow.io](https://hub.hub.dev.eu.idnow.io/auth/login).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Developer** > **API clients**.
