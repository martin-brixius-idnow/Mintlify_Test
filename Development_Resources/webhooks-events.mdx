description: Understand webhook event types and payload structure
---

Webhook payloads are minimal, machine-readable JSON messages that deliver metadata about an event. They will never include personally identifiable information (PII). You can fetch full details from the API when needed by using the respective `session_id`.

:::info
All events use thin payloads. No personally identifiable information (PII) is included by default.  
To learn more, see the [Configure webhooks →](/docs/development-resources/webhooks-manage)

## Payload structure

All webhook events include these fields:

| Field            | Type     | Description                                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `eventId`        | String   | Same ID across retries for the same event                                            |
| `eventVersion`   | String   | Current event version                                                                |
| `eventName`      | String   | Format: `resource.action`                                                            |
| `eventDeliverId` | String   | Unique per retry attempt (max. 3 times)                                              |
| `eventSequence`  | String   | Index of the specific event within a session (sequence: 1, 2, 3)                     |
| `createdAt`      | ISO 8601 | When the webhook was sent                                                            |
| `environment`    | String   | Environment on which endpoint URL was configured                                     |
| `flowId`         | String   | The identifier of the flow that was triggered                                        |
| `sessionId`      | UUID     | The identifier of the specific session                                               |
| `sessionStatus`  | Enum     | Current status of the flow                                                           |

:::info
The `eventId` remains the same across all retry attempts, while `eventDeliverId` increments.

### JWT-encoded payload

Webhook messages are delivered as a **JSON Web Token (JWT)** rather than as a plain JSON object.  
The HTTP request body therefore contains a JWT string, which must be decoded to access the underlying payload.

The JWT **must be verified before use**, including validation of the signature and standard claims such as `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, and `iat`. Once successfully decoded and verified, the JWT payload exposes the event metadata and business data under the `data` field.

The decoded JWT payload has the following structure:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "eventId": "b821e85b-7eff-44c2-8f56-af86630fd6ca",
    "eventName": "session.created",
    "eventVersion": "1.0",
    "eventSequence": 1,
    "eventDeliverId": 1,
    "createdAt": "2026-01-06T09:45:54.315Z",
    "environment": "staging",
    "payload": {
      "flowId": "d1e22c48-097f-4a7f-860b-ed9ffc1e1f20",
      "sessionId": "d4611be0-0634-4aff-b883-31de8963fcf3",
      "sessionStatus": "CREATED"
    }
  },
  "iss": "https://localhost:3002/oidc",
  "iat": 1767692757,
  "exp": 1767696357,
  "sub": "b821e85b-7eff-44c2-8f56-af86630fd6ca",
  "aud": "https://webhook.site/f3aaa67d-952b-4b7f-b5a9-ed6a3ef5a539"
}

## Session events

IDnow sends the following event types when a session changes state:

| Event Type        | Description                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| session.created   | Flow is initialized and ready to start              |
| session.completed | Flow ends with final outcome                        |
| session.expired   | Flow expiry TTL reached, no longer usable           |
| session.aborted   | Flow ends by user interaction with no final outcome |
| session.error     | Flow enters ERROR state and stops processing        |

## Payload examples

All webhook payloads are a minimal, machine-readable JSON message that delivers metadata about an event and will never include any PII. You can fetch full details from the API when needed by using the respective `session_id`.

### `session.created`

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8",
  "eventName": "session.created",
  "eventVersion": "123",
  "eventDeliverId": "1",
  "createdAt": "2025-11-24T10:15:30.123Z",
  "payload": {
    "flowId": "d08d589a-4f3b-4e9a-8c21-7a9b3f2e1d32",
    "sessionId": "d08d589a-4f3b-4e9a-8c21-7a9b3f2e1d6e",
    "sessionStatus": "CREATED"
  }
}
```

### `session.completed`

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0",
  "eventName": "session.completed",
  "eventVersion": "123",
  "eventDeliveryId": "1",
  "createdAt": "2025-11-24T10:18:45.789Z",
  "payload": {
    "flowId": "identity_verification_v2",
    "sessionId": "d08d589a-4f3b-4e9a-8c21-7a9b3f2e1d6c",
    "sessionStatus": "COMPLETED",
  }
}
```

### `session.expired`

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2",
  "eventName": "session.expired",
  "eventVersion": "123",
  "eventDeliveryId": "1",
  "createdAt": "2025-11-24T11:15:30.654Z",
  "payload": {
    "flowId": "identity_verification_v2",
    "sessionId": "f20f701c-6h5d-6g1c-0e43-9c1d5h4g3f8e",
    "sessionStatus": "EXPIRED",
  }
}
```
