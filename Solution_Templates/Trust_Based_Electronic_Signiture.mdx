description: "Enable document signing with pre-verified identities and device trust assessment"
---

## Use Case

This solution template enables users with previously verified identities (e.g. acquired in bank onboarding process) to sign documents without repeating full identity verification. It uses device trust signals to determine whether existing identity data can be reused or if additional verification is required.

***Business Value:***

- Reuse verified identity data from previous verification sessions
- Risk-based routing via device trust intelligence
- Streamlined signing for trusted devices while maintaining document-based IDV for suspiciosus devices

***How It Works:***

- The system assess device trustworthiness using behavioral and technical signals
- Trusted devices proceed directly to signing using pre-verified identity
- Untrusted devices require document-based identity verification before signing

## Flow Logic

***Step Overview***

| Step | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| 1. `Start` | Entry point; collects input DataBlocks |
| 2. `Device Intelligence` | Analyzes device trustworthiness |
| 3a. `Electronic Signature` | Enables document signing (trusted path) |
| 3b. ` Document-based IDV (Capture)` | Verifies identity via. Document-based IDV (untrusted path) |
| 4. `End` | Final decision: accepted or rejected |

***Verdict Routing***

This flow uses a risk-based routing mechanism where verdicts at each step determine the next action. Trusted devices proceed directly to signing, while untrusted or suspicious devices require additional identity verification.

| Step | Verdict | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Device Intelligence | `trusted` | Device recognized, normal behavior | Proceed to Electronic Signature |
| Device Intelligence | `suspicious`, `not_trusted`, `inconclusive`, `else` | Unknown device or anomalies detected | Route to Document-based IDV (Capture) |
| Electronic Signature | `success` | Signing completed successfully | Session outcome `accepted` |
| Electronic Signature | `identity_expired` | Pre-verified identity exceeded validity period | Session outcome `rejected` |
| Document-based IDV (Capture) | `verified` | Identity confirmed via Document-based IDV | Session outcome `accepted` |
| Document-based IDV (Capture) | `fraud_detected`, `aborted`, `cancelled`, `else` | Fraud, user abandonment, or errors | Session outcome `rejected` |

## Configuration

***Device Signals***

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `suspiciousUserThreshold` | integer (≥0) | Threshold for "suspicious" classification based on suspectScore |
| `notTrustedUserThreshold` | integer (≥0) | Threshold for "not_trusted" classification based on suspectScore |
| `confidenceScoreThreshold` | float (0-100) | Minimum fingerprint confidence; below this value result is "inconclusive" |

**Example:**

```json
{
  "suspiciousUserThreshold": 50,
  "notTrustedUserThreshold": 75,
  "confidenceScoreThreshold": 60
}
```

***Electronic Signature***

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `signingConfiguration.signatureLevel` | enum | QES or AES (required) |

***Signature Levels:***

| Level | Legal Effect | Required Input DataBlocks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **QES** | Equivalent to handwritten signature (eIDAS). Requires strict identity verification. | `ExtendedIdentity`, `DocumentData`, `DocumentsToSign` |
| **AES** | Uniquely linked to signer. No regulated identity-proofing required. | `ExtendedIdentity`, `DocumentsToSign` |

***Example:***

```json
{
  "signingConfiguration": {
    "signatureLevel": "QES"
  }
}
```

## Input DataBlocks

Provide these DataBlocks when creating a session:

| DataBlock Type | Description | Required For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BasicIdentity` | Pre-verified identity data | All flows |
| `DocumentData` | Identity document information | QES signature level |
| `DocumentsToSign` | Documents requiring signature | All flows |

**Note:** `DeviceSignals` are auto-collected by Trust Platform.

---

## Output DataBlocks

***Trusted Device Path***

When device signals indicate high trust and signature succeeds:

| DataBlock Type | Created By | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DeviceSignals` | device_signals | Device trust assessment results |
| `SignedDocumentsPackage` | electronic_signature | Signed documents and metadata |

***Untrusted Device Path***

When device signals trigger identity re-verification:

| DataBlock Type | Created By Step | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DeviceSignals` | Device Signals | Device trust assessment results |
| `DocumentImages` |  Document-based IDV (Capture) | Uploaded document images |
| `DocumentData` |  Document-based IDV (Capture) | Extracted document data |
| `ExtendedIdentity` | Document-based IDV (Capture) | Verified identity data |
| `BiometricSamples` |  Document-based IDV (Capture) | Liveness/selfie capture |
| `DocumentVerification` | Document verification step | Verification results |
| `SignedDocumentsPackage` | Electronic Signature | Signed documents and metadata |
