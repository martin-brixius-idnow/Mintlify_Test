description: Receive real-time event notifications when flows execute.

## Webhooks

In TrustPlatform, every flow runs as a session consisting of one or more nodes, such as identity verification or digital signature steps. Instead of polling the API, your server automatically receives an HTTP POST request the moment something changes. Since nodes execute asynchronously, depending on user actions, device performance, and third-party services, webhooks ensure your system stays synchronized with the flow’s current state and can notify you when new results or data blocks are available for retrieval.

<Info>
**Key characteristics:**
- Thin payloads only (never contains PII)
- All events sent by default
- Asynchronous delivery (order not guaranteed)
- Automatic retries for transient failures
</Info>

## Webhook Lifecycle

The webhook system operates in four phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup Phase">
    Configure your webhook endpoint in Studio
  </Step>
  <Step title="Runtime Phase">
    Events are generated and delivered as flows execute
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Handling">
    Your endpoint validates, processes, and acknowledges events
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retry & Monitoring">
    Failed deliveries are retried; all attempts are logged
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration Checklist

Before receiving webhooks, complete these steps:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Expose a secure HTTPS endpoint" icon="lock" defaultOpen="true">
    Your endpoint must support **TLS 1.2 or higher** for receiving POST requests.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="2. Allowlist official IDnow IP ranges" icon="shield-check">
    Block unauthorized sources by accepting requests only from documented IDnow IPs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="3. Enable JWT signature verification (recommended)" icon="key">
    Use our signed JTW to verify webhook authenticity and prevent spoofing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="4. Respond with HTTP 2xx within 10 seconds" icon="bolt">
    Return a success status quickly and process events asynchronously in the background.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="5. Use event_id for idempotency" icon="fingerprint">
    Track `event_id` to detect and skip duplicate deliveries caused by retries.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
These steps ensure reliable delivery, secure processing, and smooth integration.
