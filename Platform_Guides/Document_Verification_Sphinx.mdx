## Overview

Provides regulated remote identity verification via AutoIdent (fully automated, AI-driven) or VideoIdent (expert-assisted video). Users submit ID documents and biometrics via mobile or web, receiving verified identity data and fraud/success verdicts suitable for KYC/AML onboarding. Configurations are modular and must be aligned with applicable regulatory requirements.

## Configuration

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `inputSources` | Object | No | - | Maps identity data sources to flow step IDs for pre-filling the session |
| `shortname` | String | No | - | Managed at the credential configuration level on the platform |

## Input DataBlock

Input requirements for this step.

| DataBlock          | Mandatory | Description                                          |
|--------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `BasicIdentity`    | No      | BasicIdentity data to compare against attestation    |
| `ExtendedIdentity` | No      | ExtendedIdentity data to compare against attestation |

*If the DataBlock is not available, the step will execute normally without this information, and the flow will proceed without error.
