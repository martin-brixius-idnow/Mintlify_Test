---

Secure your webhook endpoints to ensure that incoming requests genuinely originate from IDnow and have not been tampered with.

## Authentication

IDnow signs all webhook events with a JWT signature. You can verify this signature to ensure the webhook came from IDnow.

---

### API token

You must provide an API token when configuring your webhook endpoint in the IDnow dashboard. IDnow includes this token in the request header.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your API token">
    Configure your API token in the IDnow dashboard when setting up the webhook endpoint.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the token">
    Check the token in the request header matches your expected value.
  </Step>
</Steps>
---

### JWT signature

All webhook payloads are signed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). You can optionally verify the signature to confirm authenticity.

The JWT signature is included in the `X-Idnow-Signature` header with every webhook request.

<Info>
JWT signature verification is optional but recommended for production environments.
</Info>

---
## IP whitelisting

Restrict your webhook endpoint to only accept requests from IDnow IP addresses.

<Info>
IDnow maintains a limited and stable list of IP addresses for webhook delivery.
</Info>

### IP ranges

Add these IP ranges to your firewall or application allow list:

```text
203.0.113.0/24
198.51.100.0/24
192.0.2.0/24
```

<Note>
Contact your account manager for the current production IP ranges.
</Note>

---

## TLS requirements

Your webhook endpoint must support TLS 1.2 or higher. IDnow validates your endpoint's TLS configuration during setup.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="TLS 1.2" icon="check">
    Supported and recommended
  </Card>
  <Card title="TLS 1.3" icon="check">
    Supported and recommended
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security headers

IDnow includes these headers with every webhook request:

| Header              | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `Authorization`     | Your API token |
| `X-Idnow-Signature` | JWT signature of the payload |
| `Content-Type`      | Always `application/json` |
| `User-Agent`        | IDnow webhook service identifier |
